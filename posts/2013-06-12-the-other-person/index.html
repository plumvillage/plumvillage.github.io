			<h1>The Other Person</h1>
			<p>May 24, 2013. 84-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Hong Kong. The sangha is on the spring Asian Tour and this talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into Chinese. The theme of the retreat is <em>Happiness is the Way</em>.</p>
<p>Thay has a few questions to ask the audience and the questions might touch something very deep in you. It is about the “the other person” in your life.</p>
<p>Are you in love? Are you still in love? Do you want to reconnect with the person you used to love? Do you think that he or she is happier than you are now? Do you have the time for each other or are you both to busy? Have you been able to preserve your freshness and beauty for yourself and for the other person? Are you capable to offer him or her freshness and beauty everyday? Do you know how to handle the suffering in yourself? Are you able to help handle the suffering in the other person? Do you understand your own suffering and the roots of that suffering? Are you able to understand the suffering in the other person? Do you have the capacity to help the other person suffer less? Have you learned the way to calm down the painful feelings and emotions? Do you have the time to listen to yourself, your suffering, your difficulties, and your deepest desire? Do you have the time to listen to him or her and help him or her to suffer less? Do you know the Buddhist way of restoring communication and bringing reconciliation? Are you capable of creating a feeling of joy and happiness for yourself? Are you capable of helping the other person to create a feeling of joy and happiness? Do you really think you have a clear spiritual path to go? Do you have the feeling of peace and contentment within yourself? Do you know to nourish your love everyday?</p>
<p>It is possible to create a meditation hall on a bus or train and then use the time to nourish and heal yourself. You can use the exercises from the Anapanasati Sutta. The first exercise is to <strong>become aware</strong> of your in-breath and your out-breath. We can cultivate energy to help heal and nourish. The first energy is <strong>mindfulness</strong>. This energy can be cultivated with just one in-breath. The second energy we can generate during breathing is <strong>concentration</strong>. The third energy is <strong>insight</strong>. This is a kind of vision/wisdom that will help liberate you from suffering. This is enlightenment itself – it can come in just a few seconds! To be alive is a true wonder, a true miracle.</p>
<p>I am alive. Stop the thinking. Enjoy breathing.</p>
<p>The second exercise is to <strong>follow</strong> your in-breath and your out-breath all the way through. With the third exercise, you become <strong>aware </strong>that you have a body. Next we <strong>calm</strong> our body and <strong>release </strong>the tension and restore peace. Even if we only have a few minutes, we can use these exercises to restore ourselves. <strong>Generating joy</strong> is the fifth exercise. Next we become aware of the painful emotion that in us – we don’t try to run away from our pain. From here we calm down the pain.</p>
<p>Understanding suffering always bring compassion. We can restore communication with <em>the other person</em> and end suffering.</p>
