&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_3724&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tam-muoi-with-cone-hat-300x206.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tam-muoi-with-cone-hat&quot;&gt; Third from left is Sr. Tam Muoi[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have just started the first week of our Autumn retreat, the golden poplar leaves are floating down in the gusts of wind, rain is finally falling on our summer parched grass and we are getting out our scarves and woolly hats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our teacher Thay is still in the US so here it’s very quiet, only 10 or so guests each week (compared to 220 in the full swing of summer retreat) and we are so happy to be following our new Autumn schedule after months of retreats followed by delicious Lazy Days!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who do not know me, I am a “Baby Nun” from the Azalea Ordination family, ordained just 18 months ago (4th July 2012). Although English, I’ve spent almost half my life in France, and that is where I met the practice. For 14 years I practiced as a lay person, first with the French Sangha and then for 2 years in Hampshire, England. During this time I went regularly and often to Plum Village but eventually I took the leap into the monastic river, where I’m now splashing around like a new born baby, delighted to practice and play in this extraordinary place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering how that transition went, and this article is an opportunity for me to reflect on my infant monastic life so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became a monastic because I love the practice so much, exploring the mind and being able to transform my difficulties by means of the practice. Getting to know my own mind better and with the experience of transforming my own suffering, I hope to share this to help others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I ordained, monastic life itself was pretty much a mystery and I couldn’t even say the word “nun”, as it conjured up so many negative Western cultural associations for me. Plum-Village-speak “monastic” was OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a lot older (in years) than most of the monastics, how would I take on having to change so many habits of a (rather long) lifetime?*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, when I first met Ani Lodron (Scots Dharmacharya) in Plum Village – back then she was still in Tibetan robes - she shared, “Thay’s practice all comes down to 2 words, letting go.” Thank you Ani, I’ve never forgotten your words and they often come back to my ears, unbidden, in difficult times. Oh yes, perhaps this is yet another opportunity to let go! And it’s usually my ideas that I need to let go of… Though I have to add that as a monastic I’ve also had to give up a lot of “stuff” too (elder sisters’ belongings can usually fit into 1 suitcase…).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before ordination, I expected (expectations are very good things to let go of) that my greatest challenge would be living in a community. During my lay life I had lived quite long periods alone, and enjoyed it. We do what we like, when we like, how we like!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I had also lived in a family, with my ex-partner and his 2 children, and I enjoyed that too, even though it had meant a lot less personal space. However, the thought of sharing a room with 3 other sisters and the study room with 11 other sisters, that was not going to be easy, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in fact it’s very pleasant! Sharing a room is delightfully cosy, there is always someone to share with if we feel sad, or going through a difficult moment. Always someone to give you a hug. No opportunity to go and hide if I feel angry or irritated (what I used to do as a child), so I just have to practice. Living in such close quarters, everyone we come into contact with is a mirror for our own feelings and mental states, so it’s a great place for deepening practice. There’s no escape!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_3728&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/fall-pv-2013.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fall-pv-2013&quot;&gt; on the way to Lower Hamlet[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But remembering my first weeks sharing a room, post ordination, there were many things or rather desires that I had to let go of – the desire for 8 undisturbed hours of sleep (here alarm clocks ring at all hours of the night - you may think that 5am is early to get up in Plum Village but most sisters get up way earlier than that!), the desire to sleep in a dark room (often lights are left on), the desire to choose for yourself which bed, which desk, where you sit in the van… (as a younger sister we get to choose last on most things). 18 months on I can now see that this training has made me less fussy, more equanimous, allowing me to entrust myself to the Sangha. I see that day by day my confidence in the Sangha grows, that it really does give me all that I need and takes care of me. This is the most wonderfully fertile earth in which I can grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in a community, I have never felt alone, there is such a great choice of sisters and brothers with whom I can share, or take a walk, or drink tea. Here there is such a capacity to listen and understand, (after all, that’s what we’re all here for!) I truly live in a beloved community, a monastic family. I realize more and more that simply living in this community heals the childhood suffering experienced in my blood family, where parents were often busy, pre-occupied with their own difficulties, unfortunate in that they had never learnt themselves how to take care of strong emotions, let alone talk about them or try to care for those of their children!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my 18 months of monastic life I have been faced with countless occasions to test my capacity, or incapacity, to “let go.” Happily, this has led me to another beautiful practice, deeply connected and just as fundamental, developing compassion for myself. If it’s possible, I allow myself to take the time I need to let go, above all not being violent to myself. I love the analogy of a ripening fruit, once it’s ripe it will let go of the branch all by itself. I allow myself to ripen and that might be the time to come back to my breath and open to the situation and my feelings, or it might take several weeks or months. Slowly I develop patience and self care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my ordination, being of the “good student” type, I did my best to live up to what I thought were the expectations for me. Big mistake! Trying to please is not a good path, leading only to exhaustion and despair, and even to disliking the practice. Little by little, like a toddler finding its first steps, I have built the confidence to know that I have to be myself, with all my faults. One of the greatest jewels I have observed in this community is the absence of blaming and judging. I feel accepted as I am, in fact far more than that, I feel loved for who I am. What a gift!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, on a Lazy morning (no sitting, breakfast at 8 am so a lie-in is possible) I am woken up at 3h30 am by a very loud alarm. I turn to look with sleepy, bad tempered and accusing eyes at the perpetrator. I see my dear elder sister room-mate, sitting up in bed, fiddling with her new electronic alarm, trying to turn off the noise and laughing with delight at the sound from her new toy. Suddenly it comes to mind that I have a choice, I can either be grumpy, or I can laugh at the humour of the situation because she really does look very sweet, chuckling all by herself in the early morning. Easily, I smile to myself, turn over and go straight back to sleep. Progress!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, dear friends, for all your support. Please come to visit us often and take the opportunity to flow with us in the four fold Sangha river.
A basket of ripe Autumn figs for you,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Normally the age limit for becoming an aspirant –the first step towards monastic life – is 50 but I was already 55 when I made my request. Thankfully our community, although having a lot of rules, also makes a lot of exceptions!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Christmas in Plum Village&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was the arrival day for our Christmas week, as Plum Village welcomed people from around the world to join us for this deeply joyful and time of &amp;quot;coming home&amp;quot; together as a spiritual family. Every bed is full!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hamlets are already beautifully decked with greenery, berries and wreaths, and yesterday the sisters began to deliver freshly-made spring rolls to our neighbours and local businesses who support us throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kitchens are fragrant with Christmas spices, as each hamlet prepares their own special dishes for celebrations on Christmas Eve in Upper Hamlet. Tonight the monastic Christmas Choir will set off candlelight carolling around homes close by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday Thay announced that &lt;strong&gt;the next four dharma talks will be in English: &lt;/strong&gt;on Sunday 22nd, Christmas Eve (Tuesday 24th), Sunday 29th and New Year&amp;#39;s Eve (Tuesday 31st). Stay tuned to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/plumvillage&quot;&gt;Plum Village&amp;#39;s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; to follow them live. The Christmas Eve and New Years Eve Dharma Talks will take place at &lt;strong&gt;3pm France time&lt;/strong&gt; (15:00hrs CET). The other talks will be at 9am as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also like to watch or listen again to &lt;strong&gt;Thay&amp;#39;s previous Christmas-themed Dharma Talks&lt;/strong&gt;, to nourish yourself at this special time:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;New Practice Phrases for 2014&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We are very happy to announce the new practice phrases that Thay has just composed, as an offering to the worldwide Plum Village Community for the New Year 2014 and the Lunar New Year of Horse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/new-year-new-me1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/new-year-new-me1-300x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Thich Nhat Hanh Parallel Verse 2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/joy-within.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/joy-within-300x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Thich Nhat Hanh Parallel Verse 2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice phrases are a traditional parallel verse (also known as a &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet_(Chinese_poetry&quot;&gt;couplet&lt;/a&gt;)&amp;quot;) for the Lunar New Year. They are a poetic gift and reminder to practice mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with other Plum Village practice verses, the couplet can be combined with our breathing. For example, we breathe in as we contemplate&lt;em&gt; &amp;quot;Joy within&amp;quot;, _and breathe out as we offer &amp;quot;_Joy all around&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. It is not just a declaration, it is a &lt;em&gt;realisation&lt;/em&gt;. We take the opportunity to touch off the seed of joy that is already there within us, and to share it with all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Plum Village practice centers all around the world we print out these calligraphies (keeping the diamond form), paste them onto coloured card, and pin them up around the dining halls, meditation halls and living quarters. During the Lunar New Year we hang them (with the help of a little cotton thread) from early-blossoming Japonica and Plum branches that we bring in to brighten our rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_1327.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_1327-216x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2013 Practice Verses&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poetic couplets for New Year are an ancient tradition in the East, especially in Vietnam and China. Often on red paper, they are pasted on door-frames, lintels, and even farm tools to bring good luck for the year to come. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet_(Chinese_poetry&quot;&gt;traditional couplet&lt;/a&gt;) written in Chinese characters is a masterful art - a kind of profound and concise &amp;quot;written form of counterpoint&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh&amp;#39;s couplets are unusual in that they are written in English, French and Vietnamese (rather than in Chinese characters) and they contain within them &lt;em&gt;insight&lt;/em&gt; born of decades of meditation, and a &lt;em&gt;mindfulness&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt; that anyone can apply right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
Join us in this practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can print out and post the couplets on your fridge, doors or near light switches as an auspicious reminder to be mindful of their message, and renew ourselves by applying them into our life. You can get creative with how and where to post and practice the phrases. You could post them on the doorframe as you step out to face your day, or even on the bathroom mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Plum Village, we always post the two complementary diamonds as a pair, near each other (above, below, beside - it doesn&amp;#39;t matter which) - typically on doors, windows or walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope this brand new couplet will bring you and your loved ones joy, freshness and peace in the New Year to come. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we offer you the image composed in Thay&amp;#39;s legendary calligraphy:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_3740&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;800&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/linden-tree-pv-france.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;linden-tree-pv-france&quot;&gt; Ordination Ceremony at the Upper Hamlet[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 6am on a frosty morning, this last Sunday 8th December, over 400 people gathered in the Still Water Meditation Hall of Upper Hamlet, Plum Village to witness Ven. Thich Nhat Hanh transmitting the Ten Novice Precepts to eight young ordinees here in France. Plum Village Thailand held a simultaneous ceremony for the nineteen ordinees there to receive the transmission directly from Ven. Thich Nhat Hanh &amp;quot;online&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plum Village ceremony was peaceful, harmonious and joyful, with many family members and friends present - some travelling from as far away as Thailand. Everyone had an opportunity to join in the chanting invoking the name of the Bodhisattva of Great Compassion while the novices&amp;#39; heads were shaved there and then in the Hall by their elder sisters and brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole community ate breakfast together as the sun rose over the Upper Hamlet ridge, before assembling in the hall again for a Dharma Talk from Thay. Thay spoke about the simple joys of monastic life and the responsibility of Buddhist monks and nuns to keep Buddhist teachings and practices fresh and appropriate to our times, by being progressive - or even revolutionary. You can listen to it &lt;a href=&quot;http://tnhaudio.org/2013/12/10/mother-earth-seeds/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community enjoyed a celebratory lunch to welcome the new members of our monastic family. This is traditionally a time to enjoy cakes and special dishes, and for the new novices to receive gifts and treats from their elder brothers and sisters. Both the new novices and family members present had a chance to share how they were feeling, to offer a poem, or song and express their gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_3741&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;800&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/linden-tree-pv-asia.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;linden-tree-pv-asia&quot;&gt; Ordination Ceremony in Thailand[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new novices at Plum Village all did their best to pronounce their new monastic names in Vietnamese. As disciples of Ven. Thich Nhat Hanh, all ordinees receive the name Chân (meaning &lt;em&gt;True&lt;/em&gt;). Since 2010 the monks receive the name Trời, meaning &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Sky&lt;/em&gt;, and the nuns receive the name Trăng, meaning &lt;em&gt;Moon&lt;/em&gt;. Everyone also receives a unique name for their Sun or Moon, composed especially for them by Thay in poetic vernacular Vietnamese (a revolutionary break from the traditional Sino-Vietnamese). A monastic name may express a quality that someone already possesses or can develop to fruition on their spiritual path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the names given to the 27 novices in this &amp;quot;Linden Tree&amp;quot; Ordination Family:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Br. Chân Trời Nguyện Lực (True Sky of Strong Aspiration)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Br. Chân Trời Hy Mã (True Sky of the Himalayas)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sr. Chân Trăng Diệu Âm (True Moon of Wondrous Sound - &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Wondrous Sound&amp;quot; is one of the many names of Avalokita, the Bodhisattva of Great Compassion&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sr. Chân Trăng Ưu Bất (True Udambara Moon - &lt;em&gt;the Udambara flower is an auspicious flower from heaven that, according to Buddhist legend, blooms only once every 3,000 years&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sr. Chân Trăng Tịnh Độ (True Moon of the Pure Land -&lt;em&gt; the Pure Land can also be understood as the &amp;quot;Kingdom of God&amp;quot;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Br. Chân Trời Linh Quang (True Sky of Spiritual Light)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Phap The hugs tree[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who has supported you all your life without asking for anything in return?
Fresh air, clear water, food, stability and unconditional love...
The earth provides. the earth cares. the earth loves!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s about time we love her back again...
Every day - every moment...
And with a huge collective earth hug right around the planet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When?&lt;/strong&gt; 12.12.2013 at 12 o’clock (high noon) in your timezone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where?&lt;/strong&gt; right where you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How?&lt;/strong&gt; it’s easy! it’s free! it’s fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throw yourself on the ground and hug the earth!
Run to a tree and hug the earth!
Put your arms around each other and hug the earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hug the earth ♥ share the love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/EarthHug&quot;&gt;www.facebook.com/EarthHug&lt;/a&gt; - join, like and share!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the ability to work wonders. If we live mindfully in everyday life, walk mindfully, are full of love and caring, then we create a miracle and transform the world into a wonderful place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This beautifully designed gift book contains many of the best-loved inspirational quotations and passages from Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh. Basic meditation instructions and messages of peace, love, insight, understanding, and compassion accompany two-color illustrations throughout, with blank pages for personal reflections and inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments of Mindfulness is a perfect journal for spiritual exploration, and is intended to be used as a personal notebook, or to simply read for everyday inspiration, and to help bring mindful practices and reflection to daily life. With illustrations by Jenifer Kent, beautiful details and design, it makes a wonderful gift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Sunday, 8 December at 6 am in the Still Water Meditation Hall of Upper Hamlet, there will be a Novice Ordination Ceremony for new monks and nuns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight ordainees here in Plum Village, and twenty in Thailand, will receive the 10 Novice Precepts from Ven. Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh and enter monastic life, receiving new names as they do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aspirants come from all over the world: France, the USA, Canada, Spain, Vietnam, Thailand and Australia. The ordainees at our Plum Village centre in Thailand will receive their transmission simultaneously online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ordination Ceremony will be followed by breakfast together and a half-day of Mindfulness with a Dharma Talk by Thây, walking meditation and lunch with the Sangha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new monks and nuns will become known as the &amp;quot;Linden Tree family&amp;quot;, and we look forward to celebrating under Upper Hamlet&amp;#39;s legendary Linden Tree later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

By Deirdre Mullins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks, broadcaster John Murray and Cork hurler Conor Cusack have spoken openly about their struggles with depression. The musician Bressie, rugby analyst Brent Pope and author Marian Keyes have also discussed their own emotional struggles. Thanks to this openness, the stigma about mental health seems to be lifting in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if you could go on a short break to learn to look after yourself psychologically?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditation isn&amp;#39;t the first activity that springs to mind when we think of a weekend away, but, three weeks ago, 120 young people gathered in Kildare to attend a four-day mindfulness retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event was organised by Wake Up, an organisation for people between the ages of 18 and 38 who practise mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the retreat was to immerse participants in &amp;#39;mindful&amp;#39; living. Mindfulness aims to bring awareness to the present moment, and over the course of the weekend it was practised through meditation while sitting, walking and eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wake Up Ireland was started last year by 15 people who had met on a retreat in Killarney. Initially they met in people&amp;#39;s living rooms and then progressed to having weekly meetings at Oscailt Integrative Health Centre in Dublin. The movement has quickly grown in size and there are Wake Up groups in Belfast and Dublin and groups currently being set up in Cork and Galway. The average age of the attendees at the Kildare retreat seemed to be late 20s/early 30s, and there seemed to be an even mix of men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four monks from Plum Village Monastery in France facilitated the weekend. Plum Village was founded in 1982 by the Vietnamese Buddhist monk and Nobel Prize nominee Thich Nhat Hanh. Attendees on their retreats don&amp;#39;t have to be Buddhist; people of all and no faiths are welcome and there is no attempt to convert visitors to Buddhism. The monks just simply want people to live more mindfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brother Ben, from England, led the retreat. He was joined by three other monks from Australia, France and Holland. Ben opened the retreat by explaining how to meditate with the following simple instructions: &amp;quot;Follow your in-breath from the beginning to the end, and follow your out-breath from the beginning to the end.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In principle, it&amp;#39;s a simple concept, but once you try it you realise how overly-busy the mind can be. The tendency to think about the future and the past is very powerful. Ben advised that when we find our minds moving away from the present moment, to &amp;quot;gently bring your awareness back to the breath&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has found that people who meditate regularly have reduced levels of anxiety, depression and irritability. They are also happier, and have more fulfilling relationships. Mindfulness has also gripped the corporate world, with Google offering courses for its employees. One is named &lt;em&gt;Search Inside Yourself _and it became so popular that they created two more courses: _Managing Your Energies&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Neural Self-Hacking&lt;/em&gt;. Google has also built a &amp;#39;labyrinth&amp;#39; for walking mediation in its California office. EBay, Twitter and Facebook run regular meditation sessions for their staff and have dedicated meditation rooms in their offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wake-up call on the retreat was at a very unmindful 6:30am for the first activity of the day: a half-hour sitting mediation. This was followed by a choice of &amp;#39;mindful exercise&amp;#39;; I opted for Brother Nathan&amp;#39;s gentle yoga class. He also offered relaxation sessions in the afternoons where all 120 of us bedded down with blankets in what looked like a giant slumber party. Nathan gently used relaxation techniques to lull us to a relaxed state and, judging by the snoring, sent some of us to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retreat was not silent but silence was requested at certain times of the day: early mornings, bedtime and at all meals for &amp;#39;eating mediation&amp;#39;. The monks instructed us to eat slowly and savour each bite. I found that by eating this way I appreciated the flavours of the food more and my tendency to overeat diminished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chef worked hard in the kitchen to prepare our tasty vegan meals. He was also one of the organisers, all of whom were volunteers who frequent Wake Up. This cooperative approach encouraged a warm and friendly atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day after breakfast the monks gave talks on Buddhist psychology and mindfulness. They said that through mindfulness we can learn to live in the present moment instead of the past or the future, and that it is the key to peace and happiness in oneself and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the talks centred on how to deal with difficult emotions and issues relating to young people, such as love and relationships, the consumption of alcohol and drugs and the use of pornography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monks drew from their own experience and also used analogies to illustrate their teachings. They spoke of our &amp;#39;inner gardening&amp;#39; and our emotions being like seeds, some of which need watering. The talks were basically lessons on how to make ourselves and the people around us happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern life is often defined by busyness, stress and anxiety. If you&amp;#39;re someone who wants to experience happiness at a deeper level, a retreat like this might help. Even though some of the subject matter was difficult at times, overall the weekend was very positive and joyful. There was lots of chatter and laughter, and connections formed between the participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this openness about our mental health continues in Ireland, to the point that psychological self-care is the norm. Maybe then weekends away on a retreat like this will become commonplace. I certainly felt it was an investment in my health, and came home happy and re-energised in a way that a regular weekend away has never done for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wake Up offers retreats twice per year. The most recent retreat took place in Kerdiffstown House, Co Kildare. The cost for the four days, including all meals and accommodation, was €120 for students and the unemployed; €170 for the employed without contribution and €200 for the employed with contribution. Wake Up has weekly meetings around the country. For more information, visit:

&lt;p&gt;By: &lt;a href=&quot;http://jacksaunsea.wordpress.com/author/jacksaunsea/&quot;&gt;Jack Saunsea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;love to write. It is one of the most important tasks I believe I am here on this earth to do. Writing has been instrumental in connecting and building relationships with people all over the world. While at the same time there is a certain admission I must make in this craft i endeavor in using words as my form of artistic expression: words are not reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poets use words in attempting to describe that which is in essence unspeakable truth. And perhaps poetry is a form of organizing words in such a way which gets closest to describing reality. Perhaps that is why so many texts considered to be divinely inspired scripture take on a form of poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words describe things. And so if I want to speak about that which isn’t anything, the nothingness which surrounds all things, I am severely limited in terms of words. Zen master’s will often use a bell or gong of some sort in conducting their meetings as a way of helping people understand this unspeakable reality. As Thich Nhat Hahn states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hearing the bell,
I am able to let go of all afflictions.
My heart is calm,
my sorrows ended.
I am no longer bound to anything.
I learn to listen to my suffering
and the suffering of the other person.
When understanding is born in me,
compassion is also born.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Video: Rebuilding our Health&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;November 17, 2013. 82-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Stillwater Meditation Hall, Upper Hamlet of Plum Village. This is the first talk of the 2013-2014 Winter Retreat. We begin with two chants from the monastics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding our health – mental and physical. Our society seems to be not very healthy. Some come to our retreat to heal and mindfulness can help you heal. If we are mindful, we may see that we are running. Running into the future. We have a habit of running. So our mindful breathing can help us to stop the running. Breathing is an art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness has to go with insight. Insight can get you out of your suffering. This winter we will look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/51-tam-hanh-mental-formations-edited-2013.pdf&quot;&gt;51-mental formations&lt;/a&gt;. The first five are called universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perception&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we have five particulars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mindfulness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concentration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now we are talking about mindfulness. Our consciousness has two parts – store and mind. Our mental formations can move from one part to the other. Each formation is known as a seed in the store consciousness. There are conditions that cause a seed to manifest in your mind. Mindfulness is the capacity to see what is going on in your feelings, your perceptions, and around you. We can also use the mindful waking to heal and stop the running. We can allow nature to heal us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earth is not just the environment, the earth is ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good mental formation is ease. We need to practice to cultivate this kind of energy. This is one of the seven factors of enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An opposite mental formation is called restlessness. Mental excitement. This prevents out mind from applying itself to good mental formations. Our society suffers from restlessness and that is why we run after the consumption, the internet, work, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness to release stress is good, but it is not enough. We need the insight in order to be able to truly release. Without the insight we will not stop running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is more than money, time is life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this winter retreat, we will look with a critical eye at the manifestation-only.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Video Dharma Talk: The Practice of Compassion&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;November 3, 2013. 101-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Stillwater Meditation Hall, Upper Hamlet of Plum Village. We begin with two chants from the monastics followed by a talk on the theme of compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay begins with a follow-up on the visit to Stanford University where we had the topic of compassion. Sr. True Dedication is asked by Thay to begin the sharing. The talk at Stanford was sponsored by the organization CCARE, The Center for Compassion And Altruism Research And Education&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empathy. Research of the human mind. Compassion, empathy, and altruism are innate in us. The nature of compassion is like thunder, according to the lotus sutra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First lesson: There is a relationship between suffering and compassion. Interbeing is the ground of meta-ethics. Compassion is born from understanding. Understanding what? Suffering. And if you know how to suffer then you suffer much less. Second lesson: Compassion should be directed to yourself first. Our civilization has a tendency to want to run away from ourselves. But we can go home to ourselves without fear. Third lesson: As a community, you can generate energy of compassion. This power can help others much more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a number of unanswered questions from the event that Thay spends time on now. Here’s a few of the questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research has shown that compassion has extraordinary Health benefits, including a longer and have your life. From your perspective as a teacher, have you noticed this benefit of compassion?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research suggests that the desire for compassion to help someone behavior is seen in primates and children. On the other hand we hear of adult capable of atrocious crimes. If compassion is innate, why do we not always display our compassion as we become adults?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scientists have observed when compassion is more likely to manifest. The more similar then the more compassionate we may be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are we able to feel more compassion when one person is in need of help versus a whole group of people in need of help?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the hindrances to compassion?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there such a thing as too much compassion, for example empathy fatigue?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Drink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which the world earth revolves – slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Deer_Park_Monastery_med_hall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Deer_Park_Monastery_med_hall&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am excited to share how the simple act of saying yes landed me on a hillside, meditating two feet away from a luminary human, with the sun shining down upon the moment like a beam of gorgeous confirmation. It came about last Saturday afternoon when my friend Suzani asked if I wanted to attend a meditation retreat with Thích Nhất Hạnh at the Deer Park Monastery in Escondido. As I was about to say no, some part of me grabbed the wheel and replied yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank goodness we arrived early, because he has quite a following, the kind that will park miles down a hill and walk all the way up it to see him. Fortunately, although Siri did steer us off course, we made it in time to get parking at the top of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will admit that being amongst a large group of people isn’t something I do all that often because I get a little uncomfortable. Someone said they were expecting three thousand people and someone else said they thought it could only be six hundred. I would venture to guess somewhere in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning began with a community breakfast and then the main event: a walking meditation and talk by the revered monk himself. Here is the magical outcome of saying yes and overriding that small voice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were a flowing sea of peaceful people, walking up the hill, following his instructions to “mindfully breathe and kiss the earth with each step.” At the top, the trail suddenly broke open into a large field with gorgeous views, a labyrinth and beautiful Buddha statue. People scattered in every direction. I happened to notice the group of monks surrounding Thích Nhất Hạnh circling back, so I grabbed Suzani just as a receiving line began to form. As he was about to walk past me, he veered off to the side and a mat was placed down for him to sit upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There I was, a couple feet away from him, as the entire crowd dropped to the earth and sat in quiet meditation while he blissfully drank his tea, gazing out over us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The serenity this eighty-seven-year-old man radiates is as palpable as the heat of the morning sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was definitely one of those surreal, barely breathing moments. I briefly wished I had my camera, but in hindsight, I don’t think I would have been brazen enough to intrude upon the sacred moment and snap a photo. I surrendered to the realization that some experiences are best left in the heart. As we rose, he quietly disappeared into the crowd as quickly as he had appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_3558&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/thich_nhat_hanh_this_is_it-300x275.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thich_nhat_hanh_this_is_it&quot;&gt; Deer Park Monastery, picture courtesy of Dianna Bonny[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the hall reminded me why I tend to avoid crowds. Our neatly organized area of cushions, where we had left our belongings, had been ransacked. Two young men sat in our space acting oblivious, as though they’d done nothing to contribute to the scene. Their audacity was mildly amusing. A cheeky couple behind us had blatantly moved the belongings of three women and as the tension escalated, a fight between them nearly ensued. The couple then proceeded to chat throughout the talk as though they had more important things to say. I admit to throwing a few sideways glances their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social graces, it seems, don’t always follow seekers of enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we all settled, he gently began his talk on compassion. On the altar behind him hung one of his gorgeous calligraphic works of art simply stating, “this is it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading that anchored me in the moment and gave me the insight to see that my attention could be given away to the chaos around me, or intently directed at the body of wisdom speaking before me. I did find the chatty couple to be a mindfulness challenge but perhaps that was supposed to be a part of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The universe is always offering ways to expand, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is traveling now. If you have the opportunity to see him, I would love to hear about your experience. I am still processing the wisdom of his words and will post more on that next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, keep saying yes — you never know where it might take you.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Nhat Hanh brings Dharma to Delta&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_3545&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;680&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/meditation-hall-magnolia.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;meditation-hall-magnolia&quot;&gt; Magnolia Groove Monastery[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://faithinmemphis.com/members/admin/&quot;&gt;David Waters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 10-year-old boy held a Buddhist monk’s hand as they walked with hundreds of others slowly, quietly, peacefully through Overton Park in 2002, in part to honor the nonviolent ministry of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they passed through the sunlight and shadows of the trees like a gentle breeze that day, five miles from where King was assassinated, 60 miles from the boy’s home in North Mississippi, 9,000 miles from the monk’s home in Vietnam, neither could have imagined where they would find themselves this past week, more than a decade later,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monk, Thich Nhat Hanh, now 86, one of the world’s most revered spiritual leaders, a man deeply influenced by King’s life and death, leading a mindfulness retreat for a thousand people at a Vietnamese Buddhist monastery in North Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_3527&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;225&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/alan-ho-225x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alan-ho&quot;&gt; Alan Ho[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boy, Alan Ho, now 21 and a Buddhist monk, is participating in the retreat at the center co-founded by his father, Bihn Ho, a Vietnamese immigrant who 11 years ago took his young son to a peace walk in Overton Park and was inspired to bring Nhat Hanh’s dharma teachings to the Delta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We view it as a homecoming of the sangha, the beloved community,” said Ho, whose monk name is Brother Phap Trien, said Saturday afternoon as he sat with a friend on the grounds of the Magnolia Grove Meditation Practice Center near Batesville., Miss., home to 32 Vietnamese Buddhist monks and nuns since 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past week, they’ve been joined by 100 other monastics and 900 other people from across the country who came to learn and practice the art of mindful living with the Zen Master himself, Thich Nhat Hanh, the West’s second-most influential Buddhist after the Dalai Lama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh, who survived three wars in his Vietnamese homeland, led the Vietnamese Buddhist delegation at the Paris Peace Talks to end the Vietnam War. For his opposition to the war, he was exiled from his homeland for more than three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty years after the Paris Peace Accords were signed in 1973, Nhat Hanh is on a three-month teaching tour of North America. He’d led a day of mindfulness at the World Bank headquarters in Washington, and at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past week, he’s led the “Healing Yourself is Healing the World” Retreat at Magnolia Grove, one of three such centers in North America. The retreat ends Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds slept in tents and campers on the wooded 120-acre site. Others stayed in the center’s tiny dorms. Hundreds of others commuted from nearby hotels or their own homes. They woke at 5:15 in the morning and followed a daily schedule that included walking meditations, sitting meditations, working meditations (like mindful dish washing), relaxation exercises — and no cellphone service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_3528&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;168&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/phap-trien-168x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;phap-trien&quot;&gt; Br. Phap Trien[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want to give people who come a little taste of what it means to live more mindfully and peacefully. It’s what I used to call a Sunday feeling,” said Sister True Dedication, a nun formerly known as Natasha, who grew up in Anglican and Protestant churches in England. “Everyone’s life is so busy. We know you can’t always stop what you’re doing. We’re here to help you slow down, at least stop running for a week, and be present.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of the soft-spoken and playful Nhat Hanh, who will be 87 next month, gave retreatants more than a taste of Buddhist principles and practices. They called him Thay (the Vietnamese words for teacher, pronounced like Tie).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every morning, hundreds of people gathered in the new Rising Tide Meditation Hall, sitting quietly, cross-legged on floor cushions or in the back of the room on folding chairs, straining to hear the soft-spoken Thay’s one- to -two-hour dharma teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A good dharma talk is like rain,” the monk told hundreds who sat on cushions on the floor or in folding chairs in the back of the brand-new Rising Tide Meditation Hall. “It waters the seeds of consciousness, seeds of love, brotherhood, compassion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay told stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the day the Buddha and several of his followers encountered a distraught man who had lost four of his cows and, he feared, his livelihood. “You are lucky you don’t have any cows to lose,” Buddha told his disciples after the man departed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He responded to questions, sometimes wryly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thay, if I am stuck between two paths, what do you think I should do?” one young retreatant asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to choose one,” said Nhat Hanh, who shaves his head and wears a simple brown rode like all monks and nuns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He talked about the value of letting go, looking and listening deeply, living in the present moment, being instead of doing, learning to speak, walk, talk and think peacefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone asked him if Buddhists should engage in acts of civil disobedience to protest war or other acts of violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The better way is to set an example for people to follow,” Thay said. “Create a community of peace, of brotherhood and sisterhood, a beloved community that will show people a better way to live.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh said he began using the phrase beloved community when he met King in 1965 and again in 1966.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_101&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/thay-king-300x222.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thay-king-300x222&quot;&gt; Martin Luther King Jr. and Thich Nhat Hanh[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I remember,” he said, “the last time I met Dr King, we spoke about community-building. Unfortunately King was killed not long after that, and I vowed to myself, that even in exile, I would redouble my efforts, and put all my energy into the practice of building the Beloved Community we had discussed together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, nominated Nhat Hanh for the prize in 1967 at the height of the war. King credited Nhat Hanh with his own decision to publicly oppose the Vietnam War that year. “I do not personally know of anyone more worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize than this gentle Buddhist monk from Vietnam,” King wrote to the Nobel committee. No one was awarded the prize that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thay told Dr. King he was a bodhisattva (an enlightened being),” said Sister Chan Khong, who has worked closely with Nhat Hanh since the late 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, a dozen monks and nuns visited the National Civil Rights Museum, to honor their teacher and his friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thay couldn’t go, so I held him in my heart as I approached this hallowed spot in walking meditation,” said Sister Peace, formerly known as Jackie, an African-American Catholic woman who gave up life in local politics in Washington D.C., several years ago to become a Buddhist monk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now, to think that so many years later, the peacemaking and community building that this Baptist minister and this Buddhist monk tried to do together is continuing right here. It’s healing work.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;The Horse is Technology&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;November 10, 2013. 94-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Stillwater Meditation Hall, Upper Hamlet of Plum Village. The sangha is preparing for the upcoming 90-day winter retreat. We begin with two chants from the monastics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is five days before the winter retreat begins at Plum Village. The great ordination ceremony this coming year will take place beginning May 23, 2014 and the 21-Day retreat, starting on June 1, 2014, will have the theme What happens when you die?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the monastics, during the winter retreat we will stay within the boundaries of Plum Village and this includes not going out on the Internet. There will be no individual email communication and all emails can be sent to one address only and be delivered to you. There is no need to check email. There is absolutely no Facebook too. Facebook is neither good nor evil but we will not use it during the winter retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making good use of technology. Thay relayed the story of visiting Google this last month and some of the questions they wanted to hear answers.  How can we innovate in order to take good care of ourselves? What is the interplay between intention, insight and innovation? How can technology be a force for integration rather than destruction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we detach from our work? Thay shares about what he heard and observed at Google. What is the emotional health of Googlers? They want to use technology to solve what appears to be a technological disease. Technology is taking away our time. We need to look for the path to transform our ill being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin with intention, by asking, what do we want? If technology can help us create happy and joyful feelings then we can make good use of technology. Can we reduce the amount of stress within ourselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay offers ideas for corporate and technology leaders. Good methods to use and apply technology. As part of the teaching, we look at two specific Mental Formations – contact and volition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four aspects of monastic life include learning to study, learning to practice, working, and playing. And yet these all interare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the practitioner, if we are doing it exactly like the people in the world then we may not be able to help the people in the world. No email and no Internet and no Facebook can be attractive and to allow us to become a real practitioner. It can be an awakening.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/peace-of-mind.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;peace-of-mind&quot;&gt;In Peace of Mind, Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh reminds us that integrating body and mind is the only way to fee truly alive in each moment. Combining ancient Buddhist wisdom and current scientific thinking, he offers concrete practices for how to relieve stress and cultivate joy. Peace of Mind provides a foundation for understanding the principles of mind-body awareness and introduces critical tools for sustaining authentic well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviews
&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Like all the great teachers, Thich Nhat Hanh transmits profound insights through simple heart-opening words. His voice is so intimate and open, reading this book is like sitting with him, in his transforming presence. Offering powerful experiential practices and an inspiring vision of what a human life can be, this book shows you how to bring mind and body together to illuminate and heal each one.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; Rick Hanson, PhD, Buddha&amp;#39;s Brain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Practice the gentle exercises in this graceful book to achieve the peace and happiness that mindful awareness of the fundamental union of body and mind can bring to oneself and to other.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; Richard Shusterman, Body Consciousness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, while riding in a bus Thay asked his attendant: “&lt;em&gt;Do you think the Tathagata is in this bus with us or not?&lt;/em&gt;” Brother Phap Nguyen replied: “&lt;em&gt;Yes, I think he is.&lt;/em&gt;” Thay said: “&lt;em&gt;Are you sure?&lt;/em&gt;” There were 3 buses, Thay was in one, and there were still the other two buses. Wanting to find out if the Buddha is in the bus is not difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are 50 people in the bus, and one of them is breathing in mindfulness, that means the Buddha is in the bus. If not only one, but two, three, or five people are breathing mindfully and enjoying the landscape mindfully, then the presence of the Buddha is assured. And if 50 people breathe mindfully, then that would be wonderful! We only need one person in the car to breathe mindfully to have the Buddha present in the car. With the presence of the Buddha everyone is safer and protected by his energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting in a bus, a van or a car, if you ask “&lt;em&gt;Is the Buddha in this car or not?&lt;/em&gt;” you can find the answer yourself. Are we capable of inviting the Buddha to be present in the car for us or not? By breathing in mindfulness, we can ensure that the Buddha is sitting in the car and everyone is protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the flight from San Francisco to Paris, Thay also asked: “&lt;em&gt;Is the Buddha in this airplane?&lt;/em&gt;” The answer is very clear. We only need to breathe mindfully and the Buddha will be present in the airplane right away. Usually we are unaware that we have such a great power. If there are two or three people breathing mindfully, the presence of the Buddha will be even more obvious. Therefore, Thay would like you to ask one another, while sitting in the car before traveling from the Upper Hamlet to the Lower Hamlet, or to New Hamlet, this question: “&lt;em&gt;Is the Buddha in this car?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_3505&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/thay-india-2008-300x190.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thay-india-2008&quot;&gt; Thich Nhat Hanh in India 2008; picture courtesy of Ahimsa Trust[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay remembers a trip to India, organised by the Dharma teacher, Shantum Seth. We had three hundred people in the delegation and we had to use eleven buses. Thay wanted the Buddha to be sitting in each bus, not just in Thay’s bus. So Thay requested that in each bus there should be a bell, and that occasionally the bell would be invited for everyone to breathe mindfully. When everyone breathes mindfully, surely the Buddha is in the bus. And when the Buddha is with us, we are happier and safer. So if we want to know whether the Buddha is in the car or not, it is easy to find the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our sangha should have a bell in the car when traveling everywhere in the world, and there should be a place to put the bell. In Vietnam as well as in other Buddhist countries, people usually have in their car a Buddha statue, or hang a small bag containing The Heart of the Prajnaparamita Sutra. Yet it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that when you have the Buddha statue, the Buddha will be in the car. It is not the Buddha, whether the statue is made of plastic or of jade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only when someone in the car breathes and looks mindfully, the real Buddha will be present. Thay suggests that from now on, in each car of our monastaries, we should have the question: “Is there the Buddha in the car?” posted. So when we get into the car, upon seeing that question, we will say: “OK, let’s invite the Buddha to be present!” If other people are too busy, or too worried or lost in their thinking, we can breathe for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Thay wrote the caligraphy: “&lt;em&gt;Is Buddha in the car?&lt;/em&gt;” From now on, in each car, bus or van we should have that question visible to all. We also need a small bell. If you are the driver, after the sangha gets into the vehicle, you can gently ask: “&lt;em&gt;I wonder if the Buddha is in the car or not?&lt;/em&gt;”, and ask someone to invite the bell so that everyone can come back to their breathing. That is one way to practice mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are so happy to have the Buddha is our life. But we not only have the Buddha, we also have each other and one another. Our happiness is so great! So when we invite the bell, everyone will stop talking, and stop thinking in order to come back to our breathing and be conscious that we have the Buddha in our life, as well as we have each other. Is there a greater happiness?&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parallax.org/cgi-bin/shopper.cgi?preadd=action&amp;amp;key=BOOKMSK&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/mindfulness-survival-kit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mindfulness-survival-kit&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;With this book Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh contributes to current thinking on how we can define secular guidelines that will allow us to create a compassionate, and healthy way of living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/mindfulness-practice/the-five-mindfulness-trainings/&quot;&gt;The Five Mindfulness Trainings&lt;/a&gt; (also referred to as “Precepts”) are the basic statement of ethics in Buddhism. Nhat Hanh discusses the value and meaning of each precept, offering insights into the role that it could play in our changing society and argues eloquently for their applicability in our daily lives and on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously published as &lt;strong&gt;For A Future to Be Possible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excerpt&lt;/strong&gt;
It is important for us to stay in touch with the suffering of the world. We need to nourish that awareness through many means—sounds, images, direct contact, visits, and so on—in order to keep compassion alive in us. But we must be careful not to take in too much. Any remedy must be taken in the proper dosage. We need to stay in touch with suffering only to the extent that we will not forget, so that compassion will flow within us and be a source of energy for our actions. If we use anger at injustice as the source for our energy, we may do something harmful, something that we will later regret. According to Buddhism, compassion is the only source of energy that is useful and safe. With compassion, your energy is born from insight; it is not blind energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/strong&gt; was a Vietnamese refugee who, instead of becoming bitter after being sent into exile, set up foundations to help other refugees that were too poor to buy food and clothes. He tried to teach people to be mindful of the natural world through poetry and lectures. Even though things were bad, he did his best to remain positive. I made this portrait using his poetry and teachings because I thought that doing so would create more understanding of who this man is. (&lt;em&gt;Michael Volpicelli&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/zen-batles.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;zen-batles&quot;&gt;One of the key tenets of the Zen school of Mahayana Buddhism is that each one of us is already a Buddha—our enlightenment is inherent within us, and the practice of mindfulness is the tool to bring this truth to our full awareness. While it can bring much relief, this simple statement does not preclude the need for practice. We must strive to always be aware of our Buddha nature, rather than waiting until times of emotional upheaval when it is more difficult to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh takes Zen Master Linji&amp;#39;s (founder of the Rinzai School) recorded teachings from the Ch&amp;#39;an and Zen lineages of the ninth century to elaborate on this simple truth and to give readers tools that can help awaken them to their true inner nature and bring forward the transmission of Buddhist teachings.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Tough Lessons From Thích Nhất Hạnh&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;By &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cameron Conaway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tough-lessons.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;tough-lessons&quot;&gt;
The pain started just a few minutes into what I thought would be a calming five-day retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d been living in Bangkok for two years, and shortly after I arrived I began to hear of a man named Thích Nhất Hạnh. He was a Zen Master from Vietnam and, in many circles, Thây, as he&amp;#39;s often called, was seen as the world&amp;#39;s truest master of peace -- like the Dalai Lama but with more focus on practice and less on celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons generally come to me the hard way, something like Wolff&amp;#39;s Law of Bone Adaptation -- how a bone put under stress can eventually lead to a stronger bone. As a poet, I&amp;#39;ve had my work and sometimes the ideas behind it questioned, dissected and at times torn apart by poets like Lee Peterson, Richard Siken and Alison Hawthorne Deming. But this was always only the first part of the process. The next, the crucial part, was how they always created the supportive structure to heal and rebuild until the poem found its legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps nowhere in my life was this &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; learning more evident than in my career as a mixed martial artist. I&amp;#39;ve been choked, slammed, punched and kicked by fighters like Renzo Gracie, Mac Danzig and Eddie Bravo all for the sake of learning how to choke, slam, punch and kick and to learn how not to get choked, slammed, punched and kicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I got word that Thây would be leading a retreat in Ayutthaya, a short train ride from Bangkok, I knew I had to be there. I mean, back in 1967 Martin Luther King Jr. nominated Thây for the Nobel Peace Prize for goodness sakes, and his practical lessons on mindfulness now put his followers in the tens of millions. Surely he has plenty of lessons to teach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the first one crept deep into the muscles of my back during the opening 20 minutes of sitting meditation. I hung with him during Round One as he guided us through and asked us to envision our father as a curious, young boy playing in an open field. Man that was powerful, especially considering my personal issues. But Round Two I can barely remember because of the discomfort. Pain now worked into my hip flexors and my neck. To say nothing of the other kinds of struggle, of not having immediate distractions for example -- no smartphone or television, no books or work to do but for the hard labor of being absolutely present to the cadence of my breath, to the way thoughts rolled into me like a gentle fog, to the wisdom of Thây&amp;#39;s style of working out by working in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we stood up he told us how to walk. How to walk? I think I&amp;#39;ve got that down, Thây...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every step should be a kiss to Mother Earth. Think of what a miracle these legs are. They allow us to travel freely and in collaboration with our eyes we&amp;#39;re able to see a paradise of forms and colors that make this beautiful world. Some do not have legs. Some do not have eyes. Some do not have freedom. Walk mindfully. Peace is every step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt my toes sink into the carpet, the miniscule muscles in my feet and ankles root me to the floor. Through breaking down our functional fixedness, our distractions and even some of our bodies, Thây built us back up. We were in awe of our bodies, observant of the wonder that is walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:30 a.m. Waking meditation. Walking meditation. Sitting meditation. My mind drifts: Is it almost time to eat? BOOM. He begins to tell us how to eat. Oh c&amp;#39;mon, dude...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every sliver of carrot needed the sun, the water, the air, the care of another human being. Imagine the effort to grow that carrot, take it from the earth, pack it, cut it and get it here for you. Pay tribute to that. Chew mindfully. At times, close your eyes and pay homage to the carrot. Think of the nourishment it needed to be and the nourishment it&amp;#39;s providing as a gift for your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During breakfast I looked around to see many people chewing with their eyes closed, sensing the food and the story that brought it here. Athletics are so often about choosing healthy foods, pounding them quickly and moving on. Bringing mindfulness to each bite beat me down just as much as when that roundhouse kick landed flush against my nose, just as much as when the essay I was so proud of came back covered in red ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days passed. The stabilizer muscles in my back strengthened. The ole&amp;#39; hip flexors adapted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the final day of meditation, for the first time since I entered the cage and touched gloves with my opponent, I felt enraptured by nothingness. And when I stood up I felt the beauty of moving, of the gentle buzz of our collective moving, of my body, of our collective bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I ate I...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I rode the train home I...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Thây, for giving me a swift kick into mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

Eliane shows in a straightforward way what a one week stay in Plum Village is like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She shows the different practices like walking and sitting meditation.
How they eat in silence and stop everything they do when hearing a bell, to be aware of the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentary film is accompanied by music from the album &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Plumvillage Kid&amp;#39;&amp;#39; where Eliane sings poems by Thich Nhat Hanh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film can be downloaded on the website &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oneweekinplumvillage.com&quot;&gt;www.oneweekinplumvillage.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Dear Thay,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Christopher Bono, I am a composer whom you have met before! Four years ago, I asked you a question about living the life of an artist when feeling that much of your secluded efforts are not shared with the world, and the perception that your actions are done from a place of selfishness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You began your beautiful response with, “Music is the poetry of the Heart....” and then continued with a remarkable transmission about how the energy of awakening can change the hearts and minds of the world when art is infused with and created from a place of compassion, understanding, mindfulness, and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already knew this answer in my heart, but hearing if from you helped to solidify a new, deeper connection to sound, music and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music has drastically shifted since then, and I am surprised, elated and humbled by the power it has had to bring others wonder, healing, joy, and inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am about to finish my next full length album this month. It is entitled, “Bardo” and is a prayer and story narrating the spiritual journey of my friend, who committed suicide when we were both 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was greatly because of his death that I discovered the path to positivity, happiness and mindfulness. A year after his death I was in a very dark space of despair. This was a mind state I had been in for most of my life, but at this moment I was close to the energy of suicide as well. Suddenly, in a very special moment, a thought manifested in my mind saying, “There must be another way to perceive this world than the way I have experienced it for 25 years.” It was in this miraculous moment I went to my bookshelf and found your book, “No Death, No Fear.” I cannot recall how I ever received this book, I think I may have purchased it 4-5 years before that time because of my first music teacher, a remarkable being, who had a deep interest in meditation, but I had never heard your name before that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I began reading that book, my life shifted, my practice was ignited and I have continued eight years since. Your teaching breathed new life into me and I am forever grateful to you for being the messenger of the path to peace and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to one day share “Bardo” with you, but it will not be released until the spring of 2014. In the meantime I pray you enjoy these two choral works. The first is a setting of the Heart Sutra&amp;#39;s, Unexcelled Mantra. It is an unconventional way of hearing this mantra and I hope you enjoy it&amp;#39;s novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second piece is a setting of the text from Plato&amp;#39;s Republic. I am very interested in seeing the interbeing of truth across various cultures, and I gound this passage particularly interesting, it goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is Absolute Unity? This is the way in which the study of one has the power of drawing and converting the mind to the contemplation of True Being.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In “The Republic”, Plato wrote these thoughts when discussing Mathematics, however it can easily be seen as a passage about achieving a state of Samadhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy these works. I want to thank you for the joy and awakening you have brought to my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am dedicated to continue the effort of bringing the mindful energy I have learned and experienced from the gift of your teachings to the world; through every step, every note, every sound, every breath, with all my being throughout this life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for being such a wonderful teacher. I am forever grateful, humbled, and inspired by the strength of your compassion and mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With True Love in heart resonance.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;A Day of Mindfulness With Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Barbara Chai&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh led a “Day of Mindfulness” at the Blue Cliff Monastery in Pine Bush, New York, Sunday, drawing 1500 practitioners from the tri-state area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh, also known as “Thay” (“master” or “teacher”), is one of the most influential spiritual leaders and Buddhist monks in the world. He was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by Martin Luther King Jr. in 1967, but no prize was given that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blue Cliff Monastery houses monks and nuns in Thay’s Order of Interbeing, and holds regular retreats on the grounds, located about 90 minutes from New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Day of Mindfulness, my husband I drove from the city for a full schedule that included a Dharma talk, walking meditation, silent lunch, and deep relaxation. It was our first time experiencing this type of full-day retreat for mindfulness and meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day at Blue Cliff began with singing and Thay’s Dharma talk. When we arrived, practitioners had already taken up every cushion or chair in the meditation hall—a pile of shoes and bottled water lay at the entrance. Outside, two wings flanking the hall were set up with tents and chairs, with one section for Vietnamese translation. As we took our seats in the left wing, we saw many people sitting in lotus position with eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monks began by teaching everyone the words to some songs. These are the first two verses of one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breathing in, breathing out.
Breathing in, breathing out.
I am fresh as the dew.
I am solid as a mountain.
I am firm as the earth.
I am free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breathing in, breathing out.
I am water reflecting
What is real, what is true,
And I feel there is space
Deep inside of me.
I am free, I am free, I am free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh quietly appeared on a stone path on our left, passing those of us seated outside. Everyone inside the hall, and in our section, stood and clasped hands in prayer, all of us silent. He remained still as he moved, meditating as he walked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He moved inside the meditation hall and sat on a raised platform next to a large and deep meditation bowl (when struck, it reverberated like a soft gong). As he began, he told us the Dharma talk would be a practice in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s best when we listen, we stop our thinking,” he said. He compared our minds to the soil in a garden, where there are the seeds of understanding, love, forgiveness, joy and hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_3102&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/waking-with-nuns-300x199.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Walking meditation. Photo by Barbara Chai[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A good Dharma talk is a talk that can water the good seeds in us and help them to sprout and bring up the energy of joy, happiness, understanding and love,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He discussed the benefits of walking meditation, in which every step can also help those seeds grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have the habit of running and we have to learn how to stop in order for us to be able to touch deeply the present moment. The here, the now,” he said. “That is why walking means stopping. Stop the running.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagined trying to meditate while walking the hectic streets of Manhattan where I work. It is possible to breathe more deeply and to count my steps as I inhale and exhale. That means walking more slowly, but not offensively so. I can think about each step (or every other step) and try to keep my mind in the moment – instead of fretting about where I had to go and what I had to do when I got there, or worrying about where I came from and what happened when I was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You bring your concentration to the sole of your foot and you touch mother earth like that. You say ‘I have arrived in the here and now, where all the wonders of life are available,’” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He suggested walking with two steps on the in breath, chanting to ourselves “I have arrived, I have arrived,” and three steps on the out breath, chanting “I am home, I am home, I am home.” This gives us “solidity” which prevents our mind from being pulled away, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he spoke gently, moving from topic to topic, he smiled often and punctuated his talk with quips like “Mindfulness you cannot buy in the supermarket. You have to generate it inside of us and around us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also related mindfulness to our everyday lives. He said by spending two hours at a computer, we completely forget about our body. It’s at this moment I realize I haven’t looked at my iPhone all morning (and I wouldn’t look at it for most of the afternoon – if you knew me, you’d know how rare this is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay told us to program mindfulness into our computers by sounding a bell every 15 minutes that would remind us to breathe deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not necessary to be Buddhist to practice mindfulness, he said, adding that everyone from heads of corporations to politicians could benefit from what he called “the art of happiness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_3103&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bcm-i-have-arrived-300x199.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; I have arrived I am home. Photo by Barbara Chai[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most moving segment for me was when we meditated as a group to music performed by the monastics – string instruments, drums, piano and a meditation bell. “We shall practice together,” he said. “We are practitioners, and not observers.” Divided into monks and nuns, the other monastics sang and chanted while Thay meditated in the center and made hand mudras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been taking notes the entire time, thinking about things from the outside. But during the song, I stashed away notebook and pen and sat on the ground in lotus position. I tried to align my breaths with the music, and focused on each note. The song helped me to let go of thought, of yesterday and tomorrow, and to focus on just breathing. My breaths became deeper, and I no longer felt the ache in my left shoulder from the previous night, or the strain in my lower back from sitting in a chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helped me not just to understand, but to experience his fundamental message: “I have arrived. I am home.” For that brief moment, it was true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August 22, 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear friends&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several years of living at plum village and a year since my ordination, I was recently allowed to go on my first home visit to be with my sister at her marriage in Toronto, Canada. Since both of our parents have died and we are only 2 siblings, it was very meaningful for us my sister and for me that I was able to attend. It was also the first time that most of my family has met me as a nun. I had a beautiful visit and wish to share some of my experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While everyone can tell that my sister and I are related by our smiles and mannerisms, we are also quite different in many ways. As teenagers we just tried to change the other. Of course, this didn&amp;#39;t work. Once I moved away for university, we somehow realized that we needed to learn to become friends. Slowly we have learned to accept and appreciate each other without needing to change each other. Over the years we have developed a beautiful friendship on this basis which continues to grow day by day. It nourishes us deeply and it has helped us get through many challenging times of illness, loss and the daily challenges that afflict everyone. I was so happy that she could be with me at my ordination ceremony in France last year and it meant so much to both of us that I could come to support her at her wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our differences is that my sister enjoys meat and some alcohol, which she would want to offer to her guests at her wedding (a very normal thing to do in Canada.)  I, on the other hand, have been a vegetarian since my teenage years and hadn’t even consumed alcohol for many years before ordaining. My family was already used to the fact that i do things differently.  They teased me, and accepted me with much love.  But now that I am a nun, wanting to respect the precepts to stay away from these things, I didn&amp;#39;t really know what to do.  Of course her wedding would have alcohol and meat served and I did not want to ask her to change this. With a little creativity and much support from my family and friends, we were able to arrange for me to sit at a table with 2 other vegetarians and we asked everyone at my table not to drink any alcohol.  This turned out to be very easy. After the dinner, I visited with family and friends outside of the banquet hall, where there was no alcohol served. It felt like a reasonable balance and the joy of being with my family will continue to nourish me for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the meal wasn&amp;#39;t particularly dharma-filled, the ceremony was a place that I was able to share some very meaningful moments.  I used to be a Lay Officiant and have performed dozens of weddings for people that I don&amp;#39;t know.  To get to help offer a wedding ceremony for my sister (with a legal officiant) was a highlight of my life. In particular, I was able to share an adaptation of Thay’s introduction to the book &amp;quot;love&amp;#39;s garden” during the ceremony - at my sister&amp;#39;s request. This brought in the ideas of selective watering (nourish the positive qualities, not the negative), caring for one&amp;#39;s own garden before tending the other’s garden, the four qualities of true love (kindness, compassion, joy and inclusivity) and non-discrimination. It was very simple and brief and such a delight to bring Thay to the wedding!
&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/hai-An-s-sis.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hai-An-s-sis&quot;&gt;
There were other ways that Plum Village manifested during my home visit. For the rehearsal dinner and the family picnic after the wedding, my sister was able to arrange for these to be vegetarian and alcohol-free so that i could participate freely. I heard that a few relatives didn&amp;#39;t eat at the picnic because the food was a little too &amp;quot;strange&amp;quot; for them, but they came and made no complaints! At the rehearsal dinner, I overheard someone say with a laugh, &amp;quot;Imagine that!  A whole evening without drinks and we still had a good time!&amp;quot; The comment wasn’t made knowing that I was standing there. It was just a comment made in passing but it meant so much to me.  I saw so clearly that without saying anything, someone could touch part of the joy of practice without even knowing! Had I tried to explain why it&amp;#39;s important for our community to not consume intoxicants it would have turned into a lecture and closed everyone right away,  But this was so natural.  Thay always tells us that even as novices, we can share the Dharma just by our presence and that we don&amp;#39;t need to wait to be Dharma teachers to &amp;quot;teach&amp;quot; the dharma. this experience really proved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next of the interesting situations that arose was trying to figure out how to introduce myself. Of course I use my Vietnamese monastic name - Chân Trăng Hải Ần – at Plum Village. With the guests who come for a short time and do not speak Vietnamese, I use “Sister Ocean”. Yet my family and most friends still call me by my birth name - Melina Rose Bondy. Truthfully, I love all of my names! My birth name was given to me by my parents and as they have now both died, it carries a special love from them. My monastic name (which translates to “true moon of the ocean’s seal”) is a beautiful poem given to me by my teacher. It moves my heart deeply though I don&amp;#39;t fully understand it yet. It opens me up to wonder. The English version has a powerful simplicity that inspires me to open myself up to be as vast as the ocean. Each name carries so many blessings!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my family and friends, I knew that a few would try to learn my new name and likely feel a little worried about forgetting my new name, and that many wouldn’t even remember that I have a new name. I would also be meeting many people who have heard of me as Melina and if I used anything else, it might get confusing for everyone. So after much consideration, i introduced myself at the wedding ceremony with, &amp;quot;My name is Melina Bondy, sister of the bride, and my ordained name is Sister Hai An.&amp;quot; When people asked what to call me, I offered Hai An and then said not to worry if they just used Melina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forcing everyone to use a foreign name seemed too rigid. To only use my birth name seemed too dismissive as my monastic life brings me such joy that I cannot help but share it. So I offered both options. In the end, many ended up using &amp;quot;Sister Ocean&amp;quot; as they wanted to learn my new name but couldn&amp;#39;t remember the Vietnamese. They were so happy to have an English version to remember and to understand! I was touched by the effort that they made. I know that the families of some monastics never use their ordained names so I felt even more grateful for those who did, and happy that we could all be together no matter what names were used!
&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/at-the-wedding.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;at-the-wedding&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of going on a home visit is that how much more grateful I feel to be a nun at Plum Village! Driving through rush-hour traffic made me even more grateful to get to live in the quiet countryside without any commuting. Seeing everyone getting ready for the wedding made me feel so grateful for the simplicity of my brown robes and shaved head. Doing a little shopping reminded me how easy it is in the modern world to consume and consume and consume – and consume some more. I felt the urge take me over many times. I remembered how natural it seems to be distracted all the time - with work, activities, advertising, cell phones - and the nearly endless possibility of choices. Coming back to Plum Village, I feel so grateful for our practice and precepts which make it easier to live a simple life, cultivating true peace and joy each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most interesting moment arose just at the end of the visit. I went to see Eva gold, an energy healer that my whole family has seen for years. part of Eva&amp;#39;s work involves &amp;quot;muscle testing&amp;quot; where different questions are asked and the body answers. You hold out an arm, listen to a question and are asked to &amp;quot;resist&amp;quot; while pressure is applied. The standard way to begin is to say, &amp;quot;My name is ...&amp;quot; and use your true name. Then you get to say something like, &amp;quot;My name is mickey mouse&amp;quot; and no matter how hard you try, the arm will hold strong for your &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; name and become weak with the &amp;quot;false&amp;quot; name because the body knows a deeper truth than the mind. We started with this exercise and when Eva asked me to say my name, i still wasn’t sure which one to use. so we used all three and then a &amp;quot;false&amp;quot; name. the beautiful thing is that all three of my &amp;quot;true names&amp;quot; proved to be equally strong and the &amp;quot;false&amp;quot; name proved to be very weak. It ended up being a beautiful affirmation for me! I knew that I loved my names but I wasn&amp;#39;t sure what the body would say. In the end, it affirmed all of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this event symbolic of the the wedding and of the whole visit, clarifying what i already knew. I don&amp;#39;t have to discard my past to become something new at the same time. I am still a Canadian woman with all sorts of labels and experiences and I am also a young nun with so many things to learn. I am still who I was before and yet I am also different. There is nothing to worry about and nothing needs to be left out. I just have to hold the Dharma into my heart, listen deeply to be present and flexible in each situation, listen to my intuition and just trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute. I think that this practice has a name. I think that it&amp;#39;s called mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Happy Continuation Day&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dear Sangha, Dear Friends,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the autumn of 1959, I had a conversation with a prominent Buddhist monk, and asked him many questions about the Dharma. But he didn’t answer any of them. Instead, he took out a book by Thich Nhat Hanh and said; “The answers to your questions are in here.” A month later I attended a course Thich Nhat Hanh was teaching in Saigon. I had never heard anyone speak so beautifully and profoundly. Thich Nhat Hanh was the teacher I had been looking for. And the next year, I became his student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you have read Thich Nhat Hanh’s (Thay’s) words in a book, listened to them in an interview or heard them in person, you know how transformative they can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 11, Thay turns 87. In honor of all that Thay has done, and the joy and peace that have resulted from his teachings, I hope you’ll join us in celebrating Thay’s Continuation Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, on his Continuation Day, I always remind my friends to write to our beloved teacher and share what they have done to transform their most negative habit, as a gift offering to our teacher for his birthday. Maybe your transformation was great – for example you decided to reconcile with one person in your family that you had ignored for too long, or at least you were able to let go of the hurt you felt, or you recognized that you still need to let go of hurt feelings. The more you practice to transform suffering, the more our teacher is happy. Being his student for more than 52 years, I know that receiving news of transformation is the best way to make Thay happy and give him more energy to be able to continue to live a long time with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his 85th birthday 2 years ago in Blue Cliff Monastery, Thay went back to Plum Village for the winter retreat from November 2011 to February 2012 with 173 monastics. The last week of February and into March 2012, he led a Great Ordination Ceremony for several hundred people at Plum Village with 26 high Monk and Nun dignitaries from Vietnam, 236 monastic and lay Precepts Receivers, and 37 Lamps of Wisdom transmissions. Thay then went to the United Kingdom for a talk at the House of Lords, and a public lecture in London for more than 3,000 participants, a retreat for 280 school teachers at the American School in London, and another retreat at Nottingham University with 800 participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2012, Thay gave a lecture for 3,000 people in Dublin, a retreat for 1,000 people in the South of Ireland, and went to Belfast for a talk with Legislators in Stormont Congress House. Back in France, Thay led 820 French practitioners for a six-day retreat in Plum Village in May. Then in June, he led a 21-day retreat with scientists, and produced a booklet containing a love letter to Mother Earth. In July 2012, Thay led the regular four-week summer retreat at Plum Village for 4,500 practitioners — each week 1,150 participants joined. In August 2012, he spent time in Germany at the European Institute of Applied Buddhism (EIAB) for two retreats, including a retreat for 675 Dutch participants, a retreat for 788 German participants, one Day of Mindfulness for 1,700 participants at the EIAB in Wadbroel, and one public talk to an audience of 2,000 people in Den Haag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2012, Thay walked in meditation with several thousand people at the Piazza del Popolo (People’s Square) in Rome, gave a public talk, led a six-day retreat in Rome, then gave another public talk and hosted a Day of Mindfulness in Milan, and met with the Council of the City of Milan (Northern Italy.) Flying back to Paris, Thay was invited to take part in a panel discussion on Global Ethics held at the Paris Senate on September 13th. The other panelists included a senator, an economist, an environmentalist, and a psychiatrist. He then gave two public talks at the Arche de la Defense and led thousands of people in walking meditation down the concourse outside the famous Parisian Trade Center; everyone walking with peace and joy alongside Thay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, take a moment to breathe and smile, and remember the first time Thay’s words touched you. Recall the beauty and lightness you have experienced in your life as a result of his mindful teachings and loving practice. Now take a moment to feel how nourishing it is to bring that awareness to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In face of Thay’s enormous generosity and unflagging dedication to teaching and helping others, we monastics never feel too tired to travel or teach. Together we are a monastic community of 756 monks and nuns in 15 different monasteries worldwide (five in France, three in the United States, one in Germany, two in Vietnam, one in Hong Kong, one in Australia, and two in Thailand). We do our best to support Thay and his teachings by welcoming retreatants all year round to practice with us in our practice centers, by hosting Days of Mindfulness open to the public every week, by holding retreats regularly throughout the year, as well as by traveling to different countries to share the practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also provide funds for humanitarian relief assistance and the “Love &amp;amp; Understanding” program, which supports 458 pre-school classes for toddlers in remote and poor areas of Vietnam, as well as poor villages in Bodhgaya, India.
Please join us in celebrating Thay’s Continuation Day by sending the story of your practice or wonderful transformation as a gift to make our teacher happier and give him energy so he can continue to live and teach us for a long, long time to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you have not joined the &lt;a href=&quot;https://interland3.donorperfect.net/weblink/weblink.aspx?name=tnh&amp;amp;id=1&quot;&gt;CONTINUATION FUND&lt;/a&gt; monthly donation program, you can join now, or make a one-time gift for Thay’s special day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lotus for you,&lt;/p&gt;

We visited the Buddhist monk at a Christian conference center in a lakeside setting of rural Wisconsin. Here, Thich Nhat Hanh offers stark, gentle wisdom for living in a world of anger and violence. He discusses the concepts of &amp;quot;engaged Buddhism,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;being peace,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;mindfulness.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Global technology CEOs seek out wisdom of Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and other global internet companies are connecting to the power of mindfulness and meditation in order to drive sustainability and happiness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/profile/joconfino&quot;&gt;Jo Cofino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_3113&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;800&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/thay-in-eiab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Thich Nhat Hanh in EIAB[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why on earth are many of the world&amp;#39;s most powerful technology companies, including Google, showing a special interest in an 87-year-old Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is that all of them are interested in understanding how the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, or Thay as he is known to his hundreds of thousands of followers around the world, can help their organisations to become more compassionate and effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sign that the practice of mindfulness is entering the mainstream, Thay has been invited later this month to run a full day&amp;#39;s training session at Google&amp;#39;s main campus in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay, who has sold over 2m books in America alone, is also meeting more than 20 CEOs of other major US-based technology companies in Silicon Valley, to offer his wisdom on the art of living in the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He plans to discuss with them how they can develop a deep understanding of the inter-connectedness and inter-dependence of all life and offer practical tools to better integrate mindfulness in their daily work, in the products they design, and in the vision they have for how technology can change the world. The event will end with the practice of walking meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of Thay has been acknowledged by several global leaders over the past 50 years. Current World Bank president Jim Yong Kim has said his practice is one &amp;quot;in which one can be deeply passionate and compassionate toward those who are suffering,&amp;quot; while Martin Luther King nominated him for the Nobel peace prize in 1967 for his work in seeking to end the Vietnam war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King said that conferring the award &amp;quot;would re-awaken men to the teaching of beauty and love found in peace. It would help to revive hopes for a new order of justice and harmony.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite his advancing years, Thay, who was ordained 71 years ago, is currently in the middle of a punishing three month tour of North America, immediately after a similar period running retreats across Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His network of monks and nuns represents the world&amp;#39;s fastest growing monastic order and his week-long retreats in upstate Toronto, New York, Mississippi and California, each with a capacity of more than 1,000 people, have sold out in a matter of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our voracious economic system&lt;/strong&gt;
Thay, who warns that civilisation is at risk of collapse from the environmental and social damage caused by the voraciousness of our economic system, offers an alternative vision that focuses on true happiness, which he believes we have sacrificed on the altar of materialism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His teaching is based on transforming our suffering by letting go of the scars of the past as well as worries about the future, via meditation and mindful living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pointing to our addiction to consumption as a clear sign we are trying to paper over our suffering, Thay suggests we should go in the opposite direction, to the very heart of our pain, in order to transcend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He believes that for business to play a role in slowing the runaway train of capitalism, corporate leaders need to recognise they have made a fundamental error in their narrow-minded belief that profit on its own equates to success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Living-Mindfully-Living-Peacefully.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business needs a fundamental shift in consciousness&lt;/strong&gt;
For that to happen, the corporate world needs to undergo a fundamental shift in consciousness by recognising the importance of integrating spiritual principles into its daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with the Guardian at the end of his retreat last week in the Catskill Mountains on the art of suffering, Thay said: &amp;quot;You have to consider your idea of happiness. You think it is possible only if you win, if you are on the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But it is not necessarily like that, because even if you are successful in making more money, you still suffer. You compete because you&amp;#39;re not happy and meditation can help you to suffer less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Many of us think you can only be happy when you leave other people behind; you are number one. You do not need to be number one to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There must be a spiritual dimension in your life and in your business, otherwise you cannot deal with the suffering caused by your work or your daily life.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meetings with Martin Luther King&lt;/strong&gt;
Recalling his meetings with King, which were pivotal in the the decison of the civil rights leader to come out against the Vietnam war, Thay said President Obama missed out a key ingredient when he last week celebrated the 50th anniversary of the landmark &amp;#39;I have a dream&amp;#39; speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When President Obama said let freedom ring, he is talking about the kind of freedom coming from outside; political and social freedom, but even if you have a lot of freedom to organise, to say things, to write, you can still suffer a lot as you don&amp;#39;t have the freedom inside – from your anger and fear,&amp;quot; says Thay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central to King&amp;#39;s vision was the development of the Beloved Community and Thay has concentrated his energy on building more than a thousand &amp;#39;sanghas&amp;#39; of lay practitioners around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is it possible for business leaders to create transformation through the building of a community ethos within their companies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindfulness and meditation in the workplace&lt;/strong&gt;
Thay believes that bringing mindfulness and meditation into corporations will help them to turn away from their destructive ways and recognise the inter-dependence of all life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Meditation practice can help business to suffer less,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;That
is good already because if your employees are happy, your business can improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If your business is causing environmental problems, then because you have practiced meditation you may have an idea of how to conduct your business in such a way that you will harm nature less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Meditation can calm your suffering and give you more insight and more right view on yourself and on the world and if you have a collective wisdom, then naturally you will want to handle and conduct your business in such a way that will make the world suffer less.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing mindfulness into the workplace can also help prevent employees from becoming overwhelmed by their work, according to Thay, but business leaders need to lead by example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business leaders need to take care of themselves&lt;/strong&gt;
While many senior executives are starting to speak out about the importance of sustainability, Thay says few connect this to the internal culture of the organisations they run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If he [business leader] spends all the time taking care of the corporation, he does not have time for himself or his family, but it is important to recognise that the business will profit if he is more calm, more loving, more compassionate and understanding,&amp;quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partly to blame is the increasing speed and reach of computers, which makes it increasingly hard to find time to reflect and be inspired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The power of aimlessness&lt;/strong&gt;
Thay talks of the importance of developing the art of aimlessness, rather than the non-stop creation of more projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;People believe that happiness is in the future and the point of aimlessness is to stop running and find happiness in the here and the now,&amp;quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;True happiness cannot be without peace. If you continue to run, how can you have peace and you run in your dreams also. That is our civilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We have to reverse this trend. We have to go back to ourselves, to our beloved ones, to nature, because electronic devices help us to run away from ourselves. We lose ourselves in the internet, business, projects and we have no time to be with ourselves. We do not have the time to take care of our beloved ones and do not allow Mother Earth to heal us. We are running away from self, family and nature.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most business leaders find it difficult to talk openly about the pressures they face, there are high profile examples of executives who share Thay&amp;#39;s concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erin Callan, the former chief financial officer of Lehman Brothers, who resigned months before the bank&amp;#39;s bankruptcy, put her head above the parapet earlier this year to write about how work had completely consumed her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When I left my job, it devastated me,&amp;quot; she wrote in the New York Times. &amp;quot;I couldn&amp;#39;t just rally and move on. I did not know how to value who I was versus what I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When I wasn&amp;#39;t catching up on work, I spent my weekends recharging my batteries for the coming week. Work always came first, before my family, friends and marriage — which ended just a few years later.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/This-is-It-268x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dualistic nature of technology&lt;/strong&gt;
While Thay worries about the destructive force of technology, he recognises its dualistic nature and therefore its power also to do good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why he will call on the technology CEOs he meets to concentrate on developing apps and other devices that can help bring people back into balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We need to have an awakening and when I talk to Google and the other companies, I will tell them to use their intelligence and goodwill to help us create the kind of instruments to come back to ourselves, heal ourselves,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;We do not have to reject or throw away all these devices but can make good use of them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He talks of developing apps that can help people to calm their anger when it arises and refers to a watch he designed, on which every hour is marked by the word &amp;#39;now,&amp;#39; rather than a number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has asked the Buddhist monk to talk on the subject of intention, innovation and insight, which he says can all benefit from the practice of mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay was invited to visit Google in 2011 and since then mindfulness practices have blossomed at the technology giant, including a growing number of people taking part in its formal mindfulness training programme, &amp;#39;Search Inside Yourself.&amp;#39; Meditation rooms have also been created within many of the company&amp;#39;s offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says: &amp;quot;Staff at Google want to know how to transform their suffering just like all other living beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Many of them are very young and intelligent so they can understand the teaching and practice well and can spread this and they have the means to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It will help for them to know that everyone has the wish to do good because all of us have Buddha nature. When you look at the path which is not noble, you can see the other path. So looking into suffering you see the way of happiness; that is the teaching of the four noble truths and you do not need to be Buddhist to understand that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our society needs a collective awakening in order to save ourselves from the crisis we are in. So the practice is that awakening should take place in every step, every breath. And if you have awakening you know you have a path of happiness. You stop suffering and then you can help other people to do the same.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dharma Talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh on July 16, 1996 in Plum Village, France.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;© Thich Nhat Hanh &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pebble Meditation 
&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to the summer opening of Plum Village. Today we are on the 16th of July, 1996, and we are in the Upper Hamlet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Dharma talk for the very young people. We want to talk to you about pebble meditation. You know what a pebble is: a small piece of rock. This morning each young person should go and look for five pebbles. It may be a little bit difficult but you have to go around the campus in the Upper Hamlet or in the Lower Hamlet or in the New Hamlet and you look for five beautiful pebbles because we are going to practice pebble meditation in the next seven days. Those of you who feel you are young, you can do that also. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having found the five most beautiful pebbles, you have to go and wash them very carefully, with soap, and dry them, and you do that with love and care because the pebbles are going to help you to be more peaceful and more happy. If your mommy is there, or your big sister is there, have her make you a little bag in order to carry the five pebbles. A little bag like this. And every time you practice sitting meditation you have to bring the five pebbles along. Don&amp;#39;t forget it. If you forget the pebbles, it is like a musician forgetting his or her guitar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you come to the meditation hall, you practice walking slowly into the place where you will sit down. The moment when you enter the door of the meditation hall, you know that this is the meditation hall, a quiet place. A place of peace, a place of strength. And therefore you respect the silence. Very important. If you respect the silence of the meditation hall, then everyone will profit from the meditation hall. If you make a lot of noise in the meditation hall, that will not be kind to other people who do need the meditation for their practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you enter the door of the meditation hall, bow to the Buddha. The Buddha may not be there on the altar, but he is somewhere in the garden. Even if you don&amp;#39;t see a Buddha, bow to a flower because, believe it or not, the flower is a Buddha. Sometimes I bow to the moon, and I call the moon a Buddha. Moon-Buddha, flower-Buddha. Sometimes I bow to a tree-Buddha. And sometimes I bow to a child. I bow to a child with my respect, because I know that the child is also a Buddha. If the child practices to become very calm, very gentle, she is very close to being a Buddha. So, every time I bow to a child, I don&amp;#39;t do it just for the sake of being polite. I do it as a practice, because I know that if a child is calm, and peaceful, and happy, he or she is very close to being a Buddha. And if she keeps practicing, she will become a fully enlightened Buddha. I do have great respect for all children. I do have great respect for adults too, because all adults have been children in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you bow to the Buddha, in the direction of the Buddha garden, you practice walking slowly, mindfully, to the cushion where you will sit. You make several steps. Breathe in, one step. Breathe out, one step. You walk like a Buddha. The Buddha walks very mindfully, very beautifully, and if you think that you are a student of the Buddha, you have to practice, you have to walk deeply. And when you arrive at your cushion, bow to the cushion, because the cushion is going to help you to sit peacefully. The cushion is a friend. You bow to the cushion, say “Thank you, cushion,” and sit down. Remember: one step, one breath. Breathing in, I make one step, breathing out, I make one step, and I say, “In, out, in, out” until I arrive and I sit down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I have sat down, I want to check whether my sitting position is correct or not because a correct sitting meditation is something like this. You are straight, you sit upright. Try to do it now: sit upright, in an upright position like this. But not stiff. Not like a piece of wood, no. The Buddha is not that stiff. The Buddha is very relaxed. Upright position. You may like to sit in the lotus position. The lotus position is one foot over the other. There. That is lotus position. Beautiful. Many of you can do it. Learn how to do it. Later on I would like you to draw a picture of yourself, sitting in the lotus position, smiling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you are sure that you are sitting in the most beautiful position, then you take out your little bag of the five pebbles. It is very important to do it slowly, mindfully. You take each pebble one by one, and you put it on your lap, just in front of your left knee. One, two, three, four, five. And you put the little empty bag next to them. After everybody has put his or her five pebbles out, you will hear the sound of the bell. The sound of the bell is the voice of the Buddha calling you, supporting you. The Buddha says something like, “Dear one, I am there for you. I am there with you. I am there to support you.” So you have to listen to the bell like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time during the day when you hear the bell, always practice like that. Listen to the bell like you listen to the most beloved person, the Buddha, because the Buddha is love, the Buddha is care; the Buddha is in your mother, is in your father and is in yourself. The Buddha is always calling you to go back to yourself, to be gentler, to be more peaceful, to be happier. So when you listen to the bell, the Buddha of the bell, the sound of the bell, never talk. Never think. Never do anything; because you are listening to the voice of a person you respect and you love a lot. Just stand there quietly and listen with all your heart. If there are three sounds, then you listen for the whole period of three sounds, and during that time you listen and you breathe deeply. But I would recommend that you don&amp;#39;t do it automatically. You breathe in and you feel fine, you breathe out and you feel happy, that is very important. What is the use of breathing, of practicing, if you don&amp;#39;t feel fine, if you don&amp;#39;t feel happy? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you hear the sound of the bell, you begin to practice pebble meditation. Here is the practice for the children, but I guess the adults can imitate. It&amp;#39;s very beautiful practice. I love this practice. I breathe in, and I call the name of the person I love the most. If your mother is the person you love the most, when you breathe in, you breathe deeply and call “Mommy!” Call her name in such a way that she becomes totally present, even if she is not there with you, even if she is in the kitchen, or in another city, or another town, or even if she is no longer there alive. She is with you in that moment. Call her name, deeply, with all your heart, and breathe in, and she is there with you, right away, very real, very deep. And when you breathe out, you say, “Here I am.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So during that practice of breathing in and breathing out, you and your mother are fully present. This is a very deep practice. It is not only for children. I practice it every day. I enjoy it very much, and I have more than five people I love the most. I am free to choose -- this evening I will choose five people, and next morning I will choose another five people. That can bring you a lot of happiness. Suppose you hold the name of someone who is very real, very fresh, very loving, very kind, and if you call his name, or her name, deeply, that person will be with you right in the moment and you can see that your body and your mind are refreshed by the presence of that person. So before the sitting meditation, you have to jot down the name of five persons whose name you think you are going to call. The Buddha is calling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bell] 
I just practiced “Dear Buddha,” breathing in; “Here I am,” breathing out. Wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if your mother is one of the persons you love the most, then you might begin by calling her name “Mother!” And when you breathe out, you smile and you say, “Here I am.” It is a very deep practice. Because meditation is to be there, to be present, and this we learn always. No matter how long you have practiced Buddhist meditation, you have to learn it again and again. To meditate means to be there. To be there, with one hundred percent of yourself. If you are there only eighty percent, that&amp;#39;s good, but that&amp;#39;s not perfect. I don&amp;#39;t blame you for not being perfect. I just ask you to do better and better all the time. Maybe yesterday I was able to be there eighty percent, today I try to be eighty-one percent; because the more I am present, the happier I become, the more solid I become. This is only for my happiness, my stability; not for someone else&amp;#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You call the name of your mother five times, breathing in, and you say five times, breathing out, “Here I am.” And after you finished five breathing in, breathing out, calling the name of your mother, and then you use your two fingers, you pick up one pebble, and you move it to your right. You understand? Not complicated. And then you sit upright again, and you begin to breathe in again, and call the name of the second person. Suppose you love David. David is very sweet to you. David is a person who tends to be wonderful, compassionate and helpful. So you breathe in and you call “David!” and you breathe out and you say, “Here I am.” Here is the length of my in-breath. I breathe like this: [Ten second pause]. And during that whole time, I just call his name, or her name. So you have enough time in order to make him or her fully present. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when she is fully present, you just break out and smile, and you say, “Here I am.” It is very wonderful. I think even during the first hour of practice, the first time you practice, you find joy and happiness already. I believe it. So you call his name five times, and you say “Here I am.” five times, breathing in and out, and enjoy doing that. I prefer you not do it, rather than do it and not enjoy doing it and think that it is something you have to do like a mathematics exercise. No, I don&amp;#39;t want you to do meditation like doing a mathematics exercise. This is much more pleasant. Very nourishing, very wonderful. And I want to do it right! Otherwise later on you say “Thây did not teach me right.” I want to give you the right teaching, the teaching that can help you to be happy and peaceful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after you finish “David” five times, you move the second pebble to your right, until you finish all five pebbles. And if you still have time, if the bell doesn&amp;#39;t ring yet, and then you continue the practice and you move the pebble from the right back to the left. And during the time of doing so, if the bell sounds, and there are still two or three pebbles to be practiced, it&amp;#39;s OK, because we practice all our life. For children I don&amp;#39;t want the practice to take too long a time. Just right for the young people. If they sit too long, they will get tired easily. So I don&amp;#39;t want them to sit too long. I don&amp;#39;t want adults to sit too long, too, if they suffer during sitting. It is better not to sit than to suffer while sitting. Please. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when you hear the bell, just practice breathing in and out again. “Breathing in, I calm myself. Breathing out, I smile.” You have succeeded in your pebble meditation today and you are going to put it down in your notebook, that today I have practiced pebble meditation well, I succeeded. I had some joy, some compassion, and some happiness during the practice of pebble meditation. And after three sounds of the bell, practicing breathing in and breathing out, you hear a very small sound of the bell. This sound: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bell] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sound is for you to bow, and to undo your legs and to massage them with gentleness. You practice massage; you try to be nice, to be kind to your legs. You help the blood to circulate well in your leg. You have the time to do so. If you are the leader of the pebble meditation, please remember allow enough time for the other children to massage their feet. That is the practice of compassion. Remember, because during pebble meditation I want the leader to be a young person. So you select, you elect your own leader every time, to lead the pebble meditation. And you know if you are a leader of pebble meditation, you got to have a watch. I don&amp;#39;t have any watch today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you have enough time to massage your feet, and after you have massaged your feet, you still have time, to do what? To put the five pebbles back into the bag, the small bag, and put it into your pocket. Later on you may practice walking meditation, slow walking meditation, but walking meditation is the subject of another Dharma talk. Today is just pebble meditation. So, dear young people, you know what you have to do today. Go and look for five beautiful pebbles. Wash them carefully and try to make a little bag for it. If you don&amp;#39;t have a bag today, you can wait for tomorrow, after tomorrow. You may put it in a small envelope, a paper envelope. But I want you to have a very beautiful little bag in order to contain your five pebbles. So have a very pleasant day, happy day. When you hear the small bell, you stand up and bow and then when you hear another bell you turn around and bow to the Sangha, and you practice going out slowly, mindfully, beautifully, in the style of walking meditation. Have a good day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bell] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Art of Stopping&lt;/strong&gt;
My dear friends: meditation is the act of stopping and looking. We have to learn the art of stopping and the art of looking. And the practice may be pleasant, must be pleasant. It is possible to make the practice pleasant, nourishing. It is not hard labor. People speak of meditation in terms of samatha and vipassana. Samatha means stopping and vipassana means looking, looking deeply. If you stop, you stop well. And if you look, you look well. Stopping is an art. Stopping, in order to give your body and your mind a chance to heal because, our mind has the capacity of healing itself. Our body also, if we allow it, will be able to heal itself. But because we don&amp;#39;t know how to stop, how to give our body a chance, our body cannot heal itself. Our mind also is a kind of body, a spiritual body. Our mind does have the capacity of healing itself. But if it does not heal itself it’s because we have not given it a chance — that is why you have to learn the deep art of stopping, Samatha. Samatha is stopping. To stop, in order for calm, concentration and tranquility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a river reflecting the full moon. The river must be calm in order to reflect the full moon. If the river or the ocean is full of waves, if it is too turbulent, then it can never reflect the beautiful image of the moon. Our body, if it is not calm, if it is not restful, then it will not be able to restore itself, to heal itself. You know that when an animal gets wounded because of a hunter, or because of some other accident, that animal in the jungle will find a calm place to lie down. That is the practice of all animals in the forest. And the animal will lie down there very quietly, not eating anything, until the wound is healed; because the animal knows that if it continues to look for something to eat, then its body will have no chance to rest and restore itself. So looking at the animal, we see already the wisdom of stopping and resting and calming. The animals can do it, why can’t we do it ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we need to eat all the time, every day? I just finished a fourteen days fast, and I look fine. I even look better. You may think that I am a little bit thin, but I feel fine. By fasting, by not doing anything, by abandoning all projects, all desires, you allow your body to stop, to rest, to renew itself. And that is why during the time you are with us in Plum Village; try your best to learn the art of stopping, of resting. Now a season of labor comes. People are very eager to go to the beach and to other holiday resorts, and they think that they are going to rest, but I am not sure that they are going to rest. They may get very tired after the period of so-called resting. Here in Plum Village, you have a Sangha. You have a community of many hundred people, and all of them are trying to really rest, really stop, and you try to do like them. You allow yourself a chance. If you can allow your body to rest, then you can also allow your mind, your consciousness, to rest also. All of us need it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nimal knows that there is a reserve in itself. It can survive many, many days without eating, and that is why the animal is not eager to go and look for something to eat. In fact, fasting is a very wonderful way of healing yourself. The most difficult disease you have may just be healed by fasting. You don&amp;#39;t even need a doctor. You are the doctor. You know your needs. You know how to lie down. You know how to lie down? Are you sure? You know how to sit quietly? Are you sure? Do you have the opportunity to lie down and really rest? Do you have the opportunity to really sit down, properly? Because in you there is a tendency to struggle, to do this, to do that, because you have been taught since time immemorial that you have to struggle for your happiness. And during many generations you have been struggling, you have been running. You have never been able to stop. Our great-grandfather did like that, our grandfather did like that, our father did like that, and now we are doing exactly the same thing. Always running, because we believe that happiness is something in the future, and you have to go there in order to grasp it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is not that easy to stop and to rest. You have to learn, and you have to get the support of brothers and sisters who are doing the same. They don&amp;#39;t urge you to do. They help you by doing that by themselves. Everyone is practicing walking (walking means stopping; walking meditation), sitting, enjoying a silent meal, because all these practices are just for the sake of stopping. Are you able to enjoy a meal without running, running inside? During the time of a meal, you may run into ten directions. You are not really there for your meal, and for your Sangha. And that is why you have to receive instructions properly, and you have to do it properly in order for our rest, our stopping, to be possible. You know how important it is to rest, to stop. That an animal is healed is not a miracle, because animals know the way how to heal themself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday, someone asked Nelson Mandela, the President of South Africa, what he&amp;#39;d like the most, what he needs the most. He said, “What I need the most is to sit down. Since the time I got out of prison, I have never had the chance to sit down.”.  Poor man.  Do you want to be the president of the republic? He said that he has not had a chance to sit down for himself, and to sit down with his children. What kind of life is that? When I heard the report, I asked myself whether, if he were given time to sit down, would he be able to sit down? I don&amp;#39;t know whether he has learned the art of sitting or not, but if you don&amp;#39;t know how to sit, then even if you are offered the time to sit, to do nothing, you will not be able to do so. You will stand up right away, and you continue to run. You are more fortunate than Nelson Mandela. You can afford to come to a retreat just to sit down, just to lie down and do nothing. But again, you have a chance. That does not mean that you can do it. Therefore, we have to learn from each other, and the Buddha has offered us so many ways in order for us to heal our self, including stopping. Breathing is stopping. Walking is stopping. Sitting is stopping. Eating is stopping. Meditation is to stop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healing your mind and body&lt;/strong&gt;
We have to believe in our capacity of healing, the capacity of our body to heal itself. You know when you cut your finger; you don&amp;#39;t worry, because you know that it will heal by itself, provided that you don&amp;#39;t interfere too much. You just wash it and leave it like that. Maybe in a few hours or one night it will be able to do so. So your body has the power of healing itself. You know it. For the more serious illness, it can also heal itself, provided that you give it a chance, you allow it to do so. So learn the technique of total relaxation, learn the technique of lying down there not doing anything, especially in your head, because many of us, while laying down or sitting, still run in our heads, still run in our minds. Because that is a habit since one thousand, three thousand years back. We have inherited it from our ancestors and the society urges us to continue and to double that kind of speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddha said that what you are looking for may be already there, in the here and the now. But you are running, and if you are running, how can you recognize what you are looking for. It is right there in the here and the now. Peace is available in the here and the now, believe it or not. Calm is also available in the here and the now. The Buddha is not in India. The Buddha is there in the here and the now. You can touch him at any time you want. The kingdom of God is also there in the here and the now. The present moment is the only moment where you can touch these wonderful things that you are looking for. But you always run, you abandon the present moment because you believe that what you are looking for is somewhere there in the future. So stopping means trying to dwell in the present moment, trying to go back to the present moment, because the present moment contains everything you are looking for, including your immediate need, resting. How can you rest in the future? How can you rest in the past? The present moment is the only moment when you can rest. So make good use of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let us ask the question whether you can dwell peacefully and restfully in five minutes, because our body needs it badly, our soul needs it very badly, and you know it. So please learn. All of us have learned about deep relaxation. In the lying position, you allow your muscles to be relaxed. You practice love directed to your body. You think you love yourself, but that&amp;#39;s not evident. To love one means also to take good care of your body. That is one of the basic things. But do you allow your body to rest? Are you always assigning it to do something, always? You have never allowed your body to really rest, even during the time of sleeping; your body is assigned to do something, consciously or unconsciously. And even during the time of sleep, your body does not rest. In the lying position, allow yourself to be in the here and the now. All your projects, all your worries, must be postponed. Why do you have to worry when your body needs a rest? If you continue to worry, how could your body rest? So you have to support your body by not worrying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you practice breathing in or breathing out, you have to put one hundred percent of your mind into the in-breath and out-breath, and if you can do so, you stop the worry. You stop your projects. You invest in the in-breath and out-breath. I breathe in, I just enjoy breathing in. Breathing in for this moment is the most important thing I want to do, and I enjoy breathing in. Breathing in, I feel wonderful; breathing out, I smile. One in-breath, one out-breath, can help you do that, and help your body to be off pressure, because your body has always been under pressure, not only from society, from what you call deadlines, but from your mind. You don&amp;#39;t have a habit of granting your body a real rest because you are used to worrying too much, to making too many projects. You think that your happiness, your safety, depends on these projects; and if you don&amp;#39;t worry, who will worry for you? But you have been worried for many thousand years. So enjoy breathing in, because breathing in is a wonderful thing to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddha left behind a very wonderful text called the Anapanasati Sutra, the Sutra on Mindful Breathing, and he presented to us a number of exercises that help us to practice deep relaxing and deep looking. There is one exercise you might like to practice: “Breathing in, I calm my body.” “I calm my body,” that means I let my body have a chance to do nothing, to calm down. “Breathing out, I smile to my body.” Have you been kind to your body? Have you smiled to your body? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That exercise, “Breathing in, I calm my body; breathing out, I smile to my body,” might be practiced when you sit, or when you lie down. Invest one hundred percent of yourself into the practice, because if you do well, then all thinking, all projects, all worries will be stopped. You are at one with your in-breath, your out-breath, and you allow your body to rest. So, in a sitting meditation, in a sitting position, you allow your body to rest. On your cushions, you don&amp;#39;t fight, even for enlightenment. You don&amp;#39;t fight to become a Buddha. If you allow yourself to be, that&amp;#39;s already wonderful. If you can afford to have half an hour of sitting, you know that you are luckier than Nelson Mandela. So please use your half hour of sitting wisely. Make a plan: tonight I will have a chance to sit for half an hour, so I know what I will do during that time. I will ask a Dharma brother, a Dharma sister, or a Dharma teacher, how I can succeed during that half an hour of sitting meditation. I have to succeed. You know I very much wish that the children succeed in their pebble meditation. We also have to succeed in our sitting meditation. Please don&amp;#39;t do it for the sake of the form. We don&amp;#39;t have that kind of luxury. Our body needs us. Our mind needs us. Therefore we have to love them, to take care of them, to allow them a chance to rest, to restore themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe during the first or second exercise of breathing, you feel already wonderful, because just to sit there and to breathe is already wonderful. Many people cannot afford to do that. Even if they want to do that, nobody tells them how to do it. Now we are in a Sangha. Everyone in the Sangha is able to help us: how to breathe in and breathe out, and to be relaxed, to be calm. And we have to cherish the chance of practice. And during the breathing in and out, you might feel wonderful. You might feel rested. And then the Buddha will advise you to proceed to the next exercise: “Breathing in, I feel joyful. I feel wonderful. Breathing out, I smile to my joy.” This is nourishing, very nourishing. Believe it or not, you are there, alive. That is a miracle. That is the greatest of all miracles, and you have to celebrate it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have destroyed so many moments of our lives. We have destroyed so many days, so many months, so many years of our lives. We spent them in suffering, in anguish, in anger, and that is a waste. We have to cherish all moments that are left for us to live. We have to live peacefully, happily, and that is our greatest gift for the world, for the next generation. Our children need our happiness. They don&amp;#39;t need our money. They need our happiness, because if we know how to live happily with each other, the children will learn it from us, and that is the greatest heritage we can hand down to our children. Many young people have told me that the greatest gift that parents can give to their children is their own happiness. You have to listen to them. They need it badly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So during the time you practice breathing in, breathing out, you invest one hundred percent of your energy, of yourself, into the in-breath and the out-breath. That is for your body. That is for your mind. In the sitting position or in the lying down position, when you feel a little bit of joy, of confidence in your practice, then you practice, “Breathing in, I feel joyful. Breathing out, I smile to my happiness, to my joy.” Continue like that, on the cushion. Please do not say that this is something difficult to do. It&amp;#39;s simple. You can do it. And you have Dharma brothers and sisters around you to support you. If you want to support your brother or your sister, practice well. Practice so that stability and peace become something real, in the present moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be fully alive&lt;/strong&gt;
The Buddha said that life is available only in the present moment, and if you miss the present moment, you miss your appointment with life. And that is why, go back to the present moment where you can be alive, where you can live deeply each moment of your life, and where you can allow your body and your soul to live. You do it for yourself, but you do it for all of us. We need you to be peaceful. We need you to be stable. We need you to have joy. That is for the sake of the world. Your practice is not an individual matter. Your practice will benefit the whole world. When you are able to breathe in and breathe out with joy and peace, the whole world profits. Not only will the people who are close to you profit, the whole world will profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bell] 
I enjoy so much breathing in and breathing out. It&amp;#39;s so easy. It&amp;#39;s so pleasant. And I wish all of you could do the same. The bell reminds us. Every time you hear the bell, please practice going back to the present moment, breathing in, breathing out. Take good care of yourself. Feel alive. Feel that life is a wonder. Don&amp;#39;t waste your life. Don&amp;#39;t ruin your life, because your life is our life, also. There is a very simple gatha, a simple verse for you to practice. You might like to learn it today. When you breathe in, you say, “I have arrived,” and when you breathe out, you say, “I am home.” According to this practice, your true home is in the here and the now, and our practice is the practice of arriving every second into our true home, which is the present moment, the only moment when life is available. We have been running all our lives to the past, to the future, to our projects. Now it is time to go home. And if you go home and look and touch deeply, you&amp;#39;ll be surprised to see that what you are looking for is already there. Peace is available. Touch it, live it, enjoy. And when you do it, peace will reveal itself more and more clearly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have arrived. I am home.” It means that I don&amp;#39;t have to run anymore. When you hear the bell, you say “Listen, listen. This wonderful sound brings me back to my true home.” My true home is here and now. The  here and the now is universal. “Here” is not Plum Village; “here” is everywhere you are, and “now” is something that goes along with the here, because the here and the now cannot be divided. They are just one thing, and that is your true home. If you think that the Kingdom of God is your true home, then the Kingdom of God is in the here and the now. You don&amp;#39;t have to die in order to enter the Kingdom of God. In fact, you have to be very alive in order to do so. To be fully alive, to go back to the present moment, and to be there with one hundred percent of you, means to be alive. “I have arrived, I am home.” On your cushion, practice arriving. You arrive in every second, every minute, to be there, alive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During walking meditation, you also practice arriving. If you practice slow walking in the hall, you take one step, you take one in-breath and you say “I have arrived.” How wonderful! It&amp;#39;s easy, simple; it&amp;#39;s very pleasant to practice. Your left foot touches the floor, the wooden floor. It&amp;#39;s wonderful. Do you know that the wood is made of cloud and sunshine? The wood is made of cloud and sunshine and wind and earth, and for your feet to touch the wood, it&amp;#39;s a very wonderful thing. If you are really there, you feel it, but if you are elsewhere, you don&amp;#39;t feel it. Wood is nothing, your foot is nothing, you are nothing, because you are not there, in the here and the now. You breathe in and you say, “I have arrived.” You cut through all thinking, all projects, all worries; you go back and establish yourself firmly in the present moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One step only, one breath only, and already you can realize a miracle, the miracle of being fully alive. Don&amp;#39;t tell me that you cannot do that. You know that you can do that. Just breathe in, and make it one step, and become fully alive by bringing yourself entirely back to the present moment. And when you breathe out, you are already a wonder, because to be alive and to be walking on the earth is a miracle. Remember, you have seen a dead body. You cannot make that dead body rise and practice walking meditation anymore. But you are not a dead body. You are alive, and your feet are strong enough to enjoy walking meditation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transformation through Mindfulness&lt;/strong&gt;
Plum Village is made for you to practice walking. Many thousand people have been walking around here, mindfully, and enjoying every second. The site has become a holy site, because mindfulness has been printed again and again on this soil. This soil during World War II was a place where tragedy took place, but because of our practice, we have transformed the atmosphere, we have transformed the land&amp;#39;s soil. It is now a very peaceful, very holy place. Thanks to you all who have come to Plum Village and practiced with us. You practice walking meditation all year round, and we print our peace, our joy, on this soil, on this very soil. And when you practice walking around here you feel energy of practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you say “I have arrived,” breathing in, and when you say, “I am home,” breathing out, you feel that you don&amp;#39;t need to do anything else. Why do you have to pursue that project? Why do you think that if you don&amp;#39;t realize the project, happiness is not possible? So you are able to realize stopping. Happiness is simple: I can have it right here and right now, and conditions for my happiness seem to be more than enough. I am still alive. My feet are still strong, my eyes are still in good condition, I can see the blue sky. I can see all kinds of forms and colors. My ears are also still in good condition. I can listen to all kinds of sounds, including the sounds of the birds. And my heart is functioning normally. You see, there are so many conditions for your happiness that are available, but because we are looking for another condition, that is why we deny all these conditions that already exist. That is a loss. That is a pity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awakening -- Buddhism is the teaching of awakening. You have to wake up in order to realize that everything you are looking for is already there, may already be there. You have to recognize it. And walking meditation is also to stop. Even if you are still walking, you have already stopped. And if you make three hundred steps, make sure that each step brings you back peace, stability, and joy. Don&amp;#39;t just walk like that, letting your mind wander around, going into the ten directions. Bring your mind back and tie it to your feet. Enjoy every step you make. Do it for all of us. If you can smile a smile of happiness, that will be very nourishing for your body, for your mind, for your Sangha, for the whole world. We need your smile badly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have arrived, I am home.” You practice like that for a few minutes. One breath, one step, in the meditation hall. And after some time you switch into the second exercise: “In the here and in the now,” “In the here and in the now.” It is exactly the same kind of practice. You have brought back yourself to the present moment. Maybe you have brought eighty percent of yourself back to the present moment. There is still twenty percent more to do. So when you say, “In the here and in the now,” you may be able to be completely mindful and present. So each in-breath is to bring you back to the here; each out-breath is supposed to bring you back to the now, in the here and the now, because the here and the now is wonderful. Don&amp;#39;t just say the word. It is silly just to say the word. The word is a means to help with your concentration, to show you what you are really doing, making peaceful, mindful, and happy thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have arrived, I am home, in the here and in the now.” And a few minutes of practice will bring you more stability and freedom. Freedom from what? This is not political freedom. Freedom from worries, freedom from suffering. You get it slowly, just by dwelling in the present moment, and touching the wonders of life. You will get rid of the kind of worries that are not essential at all, because peace and joy are possible. Why do you have to worry too much? “I am solid,” because you have become solid. This is not autosuggestion, because after few minutes of practicing arriving in the here and the now, you feel that you are more solid, and you feel that you are more free. Free from what? Free from these worries, free from these anxieties, from these projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that solidity and freedom are the two characteristics, the two basic characteristics, of nirvana. Nirvana is a state of being where solidity and freedom exist, and you can touch nirvana right in the first hour of practice. And if you continue the touching you&amp;#39;ll be deeper and deeper all the time, until you can touch nirvana one hundred percent. The Buddha said that in the here and the now, you can touch nirvana with your own body. He did not say with your mind. Touching nirvana with your own body that is the way Buddha put it. It is possible. It is not an idea. It is not a notion. It is something you already can do. And happiness will be something possible if stability and freedom are there. To practice means to cultivate solidity and freedom, which are essential to our well-being, essential to our happiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have arrived, I am home,” and then, “In the here, in the now.” Then, “I am solid, I am free.” And finally, “In the ultimate I dwell.” Or, if you want, “In the Buddha-land I dwell,” or “In the Kingdom of God I dwell,” because nirvana, the Buddha-land, the Kingdom of God, is available in the here and the now, and you have begun to touch it. The depth of your touching depends on your concentration, on your mindfulness, on your stability. André Gide said that God is available to you twenty-four hours a day. André Gide is a French author, and he&amp;#39;s right. Nirvana also, the Buddha, the Buddha-land also, is available to you twenty-four hours a day if you care, if you really care. If you go back to the present moment and make yourself available, and then the other thing is also available. The other thing is the full moon, the cherry blossoms, the blue sky, the smile of your beloved one, life, nirvana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#39;t be satisfied with words and notions. You have to get the real thing. The real thing is stability, solidity, and freedom. “I am solid, I am free. In the Buddha-land I dwell.” And walking like that can make you very happy. You are there, but you are already in the real thing, in the ultimate. The ultimate means the world of no birth, no death. Nirvana is the world of no birth and no death. If you dwell in the present moment and if you practice looking deeply, one time, one day, you will touch very deeply the ground of your being, the ground of your being where birth and death vanish. It&amp;#39;s like a wave. If the wave practices touching itself deeply, it will touch the water inside itself. A wave might be born or might be dying, but the water is not subjected to birth and death. Your true nature is the nature of no birth and no death, the nature of nirvana. So if you walk deeply, you begin to touch your own nature. That is why we say “In the ultimate I dwell.” It&amp;#39;s very deep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you practice walking meditation outside, you can do it more quickly. Instead of one step, one breath, you make two steps, or even three steps, one breath. Instead of simply doing “I have arrived, I am home,” you do like this: “I have arrived, arrived, I am home, home.” So breathing in, I make two steps, two beautiful steps, and when I breathe out, I make two beautiful steps, and I enjoy it just the same. When you go back to your city and practice walking meditation in Central Park, you wouldn&amp;#39;t like to go too slowly, like in the meditation hall. People will look at you and wonder what you are doing, you don&amp;#39;t look very normal. You want to be normal, you want to be natural. So you can be very mindful, very concentrated, and yet you can look absolutely natural. You can make three steps while breathing in: “I have arrived, arrived, arrived.” You don&amp;#39;t have to close your eyes. In fact you have to open your eyes in order to enjoy the trees, the birds, the blue sky, and the people around you. And yet you are concentrated, because you are following your in-breath and out-breath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have arrived, arrived, arrived. I am home, I am home, I am home.” You&amp;#39;ll be surprised to see that you have no desires left. That&amp;#39;s wonderful. True happiness is only available if you have no desire. No desire is the object of my deepest desire. Why should I desire anything else? If I found it is wonderful in the here and the now and I have everything, why should I desire something else? Not a difficult thing. So, please practice and discover that the miracles, the jewels, the most precious things you are looking for are already available: the fact that you are alive, and many wonders of life within you and around you. So during the time you practice walking with the Sangha outside, you can make three steps or two steps, but I would advise you to use the same kind of speed that the Sangha is using, so that you become part of the harmony, of the symphony. And to walk like that is just to enjoy life. To be walking mindfully and enjoy every step you make is to celebrate life. You don&amp;#39;t have an orchestra with you. You don&amp;#39;t have drums or trumpets and other things in order to celebrate. You just touch the earth and walk with the other brothers and sisters, and you are celebrating the fact that you are alive, and you do it very deeply because you are dwelling in the here and the now. And during the time of walking, your body rests. Your mind rests, also. Not only during the time of sitting or lying down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About eating: eating is also resting. Eating is a very deep practice. You sit there with the community and you offer one hundred percent of yourself, not less. Don&amp;#39;t sit somewhere else. Please sit with us one hundred percent. And you know in order to do that, in order to offer us your true presence, you have to practice mindful breathing. Mindful breathing will bring you back to the here and the now. We need you to be with us. And during the whole time of the meal, we touch only two things; our mind touches only two things: the food, which is the gift of the sky and the earth, and also the community of practice that is there. My mind does not think or embrace anything else, because to be alive, to be sitting there and enjoying a meal with brothers and sisters in the practice, is a wonderful thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something practiced by the Buddha and his monks and nuns during that time. It is called “one sitting lunch.” You sit down very beautifully and you enjoy the meal until the end; meanwhile, you don&amp;#39;t think. And you have to enjoy every moment of the meal. Sit upright, look at the food, smile to it. Each morsel of food is an ambassador from the cosmos. It contains sunshine, clouds, the sky, the earth, the farmer, everything. Each morsel of the food is a piece of bread offered to you by Jesus Christ during the Last Supper. You have to eat it mindfully, in mindfulness. Look into the piece of bread, look into the piece of carrot you are eating, one hundred percent of yourself, and touch that, deeply. When you pick up one piece of carrot, don&amp;#39;t put it into your mouth yet. Look at it and smile to it. And if you are mindful, you will see deeply into the piece of carrot. Sunshine is inside. A cloud is inside. The great earth is inside. A lot of love, a lot of hard work is inside. And when you have seen clearly the real piece of carrot, you put it into your mouth, and you chew it mindfully. And please, be sure to chew only carrots, and not your projects, not your worries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is deep practice: enjoy chewing your carrot. It is wonderful. The piece of carrot is a miracle. You, also, are a miracle. And chew carefully. In Plum Village, we chew from thirty times to fifty times, because we love it. We don&amp;#39;t have to do it, but because the time being together is wonderful. So you just spend time with your food, and every minute of your lunch should be happy. And from time to time, you would pause and look and smile at a sister or a brother in the Dharma. Not many people, including Nelson Mandela, have the time, have the chance, have the opportunity to sit down and enjoy a meal like that. We are very fortunate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are very glad that you have come and shared the summer opening with us. Today we have a formal meal, like in the tradition. It&amp;#39;s a little bit longer than in other days, but we have to keep the tradition alive, so each week, we have just one formal meal, and during the time of the meal, we offer a little bit of food, symbolically, to living beings before we eat. Now it is time for walking meditation, to celebrate the fact that we are all still alive, then after that we will take a break before participating in the weekly formal meal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have learned how to walk. Please, from this time on, every time you need to walk, only use the style of walking meditation. We don&amp;#39;t use any other kind of walking style here, just walking like you are, the happiest person ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world we are asking, How can our children grow up to be peace-builders? How can they learn to use the conflicts of the past to provide compost for lasting harmony in our communities, our nations, and the world? Planting seeds is a film to answer these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a project to show us how mindfulness can help to water the seeds of beauty and goodness in each child, and, importantly, how each child can learn to water those seeds in themselves and others for their lifetime, and for successive generations.We are beyond the time of saying that such an education is desirable. For the health, sustainability, and happiness of our global community, it is now our only real option.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;A Path To Peace&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Thay-portrait-150x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;Wake up New York! Revered Buddhist monk &lt;a href=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/about/thich-nhat-hanh/&quot;&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/a&gt; is coming to town. While his retreat is sold out, there are still tickets available to his talk on September 7 at NYC’s Beacon Theater. The events are part of his “&lt;a href=&quot;http://tnhtour.org&quot;&gt;Nourishing Great Togetherness&lt;/a&gt;” Tour and will include a dharma talk on mindfulness practices that can be incorporated into daily routines along with guided meditation, singing, chanting, and prayers for peace. Thich Nhat Hanh will also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thichnhathanhcalligraphy.org/newyork/&quot;&gt;premiere a calligraphy exhibit&lt;/a&gt; on September 7 at ABC Home, hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://bluecliffmonastery.org/&quot;&gt;Blue Cliff Monastery&lt;/a&gt; and ABC Home, near Union Square. It will run through December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dalai Lama has deemed this humble monk one of the world&amp;#39;s leading spiritual teachers and Martin Luther King nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize for his activism during the Vietnam War. Many were first exposed to his seminal thinking through Peace is Every Step, a book where he writes “Peace is present right here and now… the question is whether or not we are in touch with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book introduced the concept of mindfulness, when we are consciously aware of the state of our body, breath, and mind along with the other sensations that surround us rather than being lost in thoughts of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By masterfully merging introspective mindfulness practices with compassionate and non-violent action, Thich Nhat Hanh sparked the movement known as Applied Buddhism. At 87, looking decades younger, he offers an inspiring example of how we can move simultaneously toward inner and world peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YogaCity NYC&amp;#39;s Lauren Tepper interviewed Thich Nhat Hanh about his essential teachings and intentions for this North American tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren Tepper&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Can you sum up the message you want to share?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/strong&gt;: Happiness is possible. Healing is possible. Mindfulness practice can help us to transform stress, violence, discrimination, and alienation. The present moment offers many nourishments that can nurture the seeds of gratitude, joy, and hope within us. All we need to do is allow our mindful steps and conscious breathing to anchor us to each present moment, to be attentive to the changes that are constantly happening within and around us. With these practices, we can let go of stress and enjoy simply breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren Tepper&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Which practices do you feel are most essential right now?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/strong&gt;: When we are busy, we may not think we have time to practice meditation or mindfulness. But in fact, we only need to commit to small pauses to check in with our body and become aware of our breath. In the monastery, we use the clock chime as a reminder to stop whatever we are doing and come back to the present moment. We breathe mindfully for at least three in and out breaths before continuing what we were doing. These small and regular pauses are a part of our practice, and it helps us to have peace and equilibrium throughout the day.
In New York, you may not have a clock that chimes every fifteen minutes, but you do have traffic lights, stop signs, and landmarks along your path between work and home. You can practice intelligently by using some of these external cues as “bells of mindfulness” - reminders to pause and bring some rest and awareness into your life. You can designate certain times throughout the day and certain places as zones of peace by pausing to breathe mindfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren Tepper&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Tell me about your vision of “Great Togetherness.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/strong&gt;: Individualism has brought about alienation, despair, and violence. When we look deeply, we see that we are intricately connected to one another. A flower cannot be by herself alone, she must inter-be with everything else -- sun, rain, soil, air, and so on. The well-being of humans cannot be possible without the well-being of plants, animals, and minerals. A collective awakening into our connectedness can help us make wise individual, economic, and political decisions that promote not only our own happiness but the happiness of others as well.
In our community, we practice The Five Mindfulness Trainings - reverence for life, true happiness, true love, true communication, and mindful consumption - which can serve as our global ethics. You can learn more about them on our website. Everyone can practice them in order to ensure the happiness of the individual, the family, the society, and the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a kind of radio in our minds called NST, Non-Stop Thinking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren Tepper&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;You call your upcoming retreat “Transformation and Healing – the Art of Suffering.” Can you explain what you mean by suffering as an ‘art,’ and how this relates to transformation and healing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/strong&gt;: Art has the capacity to open our hearts and minds to deeper truths and to help us touch beauty. It is the same with suffering. As practitioners, we learn to relate to suffering in a beneficial way. It’s like the way we grow lotus flowers. Without the mud you cannot grow the flowers. Suffering is a kind of mud that we need in order to grow the feelings of joy and happiness. If we know how to skillfully apply the practices of mindfulness, concentration, and loving-kindness in the midst of our suffering, we can transform it into greater understanding, compassion, and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren Tepper&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;How do you remain hopeful about peace amidst all the violence in the world?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/strong&gt;: Violence in the world is related to our lack of peace in our daily lives. Many of us are keenly attentive to the political, social, and environmental spheres, yet we have lost very basic contact with what is going on in our own body and mind. When we practice mindful breathing and mindful walking on a daily basis, we are bringing peace into our lives in a concrete way. We become aware and can take better care of our physical and mental health.
This is the way we nurture peace and strengthen our capacity to face the larger challenges that we collectively face. We embody the peace that we would like to see in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren Tepper&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;How can we stay present in meditation when we feel physical pain or mental anguish?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/strong&gt;: Meditation should be pleasant. When there is pain it may be that we need a different cushion or a different sitting position, even if it is on a chair. At times of course some pain is inevitable; but suffering is optional.
Suppose someone is hit by an arrow. If a second arrow comes and strikes at exactly the same spot, the pain may be unbearable. The worry, the anger, the despair of our mind is the second arrow. If we don&amp;#39;t let the second arrow hit us, we will have enough capacity to handle the physical pain. So when we have some pain in our body, the practice is to breathe in and out, to recognize it as it is and not to exaggerate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren Tepper&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;How can we move beyond the mental knowledge that we are all connected spiritual beings, into really feeling that connection in our day to day lives?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/strong&gt;: There is a kind of radio in our minds called NST, Non-Stop Thinking. We have to turn off that kind of radio in order to feel connected to life. Of course there is right thinking which helps us - but most of our thinking is wrong thinking. When we are walking from one place to another we turn off that radio. We focus entirely on our in-breath, our out-breath, and our steps. With each step we touch earth, and in this way we can experience all the wonders of life. It is not difficult to turn off the radio inside if you find pleasure in breathing and walking.
You don&amp;#39;t need to use force. Just pay attention to your in-breath and out-breath - do not interfere. Learning how to quiet mental discourse can help us connect more deeply to our loved ones and everyone around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren Tepper&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;How do you fit self-care into your busy traveling and teaching schedule so as not to get burned out?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/strong&gt;: Whether sitting on a bus or an airplane, or going from place to place, it is possible to get rest and nourishment in every breath. Mindfulness can help us recognize promptly the tension and stress building up, and we can relax by becoming conscious of our natural breathing. Taking good care of ourselves is the kindest and most important service that we may offer to our loved ones and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren Tepper&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;If you could give just one piece of advice to someone who is interested in practicing meditation, what would it be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/strong&gt;: Find a sangha: a community of practitioners who come together to share the practice and encourage each other in the practice. The sangha is like our body and we are like the cells.
A lot of New Yorkers come to Blue Cliff Monastery to experience this. There are also local sanghas in New York (to find one you can go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://iamhome.org&quot;&gt;iamhome.org&lt;/a&gt;. When you allow yourself to be embraced by that collective energy, you feel much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calligraphies will be on sale during the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thichnhathanhcalligraphy.org/newyork/&quot;&gt;Exhibition at ABC Home&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I jump at the chance to learn from a living legend of non-violence, despite the 5:30 wake-up call and hours sitting in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Alice Klein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2962&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/why-is-it-wrong-to-kill-300x198.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Q&amp;amp;A at Lower Hamlet, photo by Plum Village[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True love and happiness? Is that a fairy tale? Not according to fearless 86-year-old social activist monk and Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh (pronunced “tik nyat hawn”), who’s sitting serenely cross-legged onstage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m about to get some very simple how-to advice, but right now I’m not happy. I’m tired, and frankly, some family drama just erupted and has taken over my brain. Of course it happened right before this Brock University retreat with Nhat Hanh that preceded his Toronto talk last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I decided to jump at the chance to spend six days learning from one of the world’s few living legends of non-violence, I wasn’t thinking ahead to the 5:30 wake-up call and the school-cafeteria vegan. Or sitting inside a giant gym impressively stuffed with 1,300 silent others. (Noble silence in effect from evening to lunch and during meals.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had wanted to feel the live spiritual presence of Buddhism’s second-most revered teacher. But as fate and being human would have it, Nhat Hanh would have to teach me how to be in the here and now enough to actually feel the present first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the Dalai Lama, Nhat Hanh’s artfully simple Buddhist take on peace and reconciliation was forged in the cauldron of political violence, oppression and unspeakable pain. During the Vietnam War, he was the founding father of a movement of “engaged Buddhism” that inspired thousands of monks and nuns in that country to leave their contemplative monastic life to support devastated war- and poverty-racked communities. They were committed to non-violently waging peace from the inside out. This was his mission, and it has jumped many borders and never ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Nhat Hanh was finally barred from returning to Vietnam in 1966 after two decades of social activism for his vastly challenged generation, he continued his efforts to build opposition to the war in the U.S. and around the world. Martin Luther King Jr. nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize. King became fully committed himself to opposing the war through conversation with this radiant Prince of Happiness sitting here in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He doesn’t show his age. He is monk-bald and a bit Spock-like in long brown robes, with dark triangle brows dancing over the dazzle in his deep-set eyes. He is about to offer a teaching on what he calls the art of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So apparently I will have to get busy with my broken heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, anyone who has read one word of this man’s 80-plus books (not to mention CDs, videos and more – this whole retreat is available on YouTube), knows that everything Nhat Hanh teaches begins in one simple way: an in-breath, an inhalation breathed with attention all the way down into the body. He says that is all it takes to get back to the wonder of being alive in present-moment happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try it, and my in-breath really does connect me with my body. Wow. I definitely feel that. I breathe in and then follow it down (“I have arrived,” he says to say inwardly), and then enjoy letting it out – the full, relaxing out-breath (“I am home”). He calls that mindful breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. I admit my heart’s wrenching still commands most of my attention, but this instant pathway to mind-body connection is profound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within us we carry the suffering of our father, of our mother, of our ancestors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the duration of that breath I shift out of the cacophony in my head into a different awareness. This is what the present feels like. I cannot believe that despite my decades of research, I have just discovered this instant way to connect so simply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The art of suffering” requires that same breath-aware energy of mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is suffering inside every one of us,” he says gently. “And with the energy of mindfulness, you go home to yourself and you can recognize the suffering. [Yeah, I have done the first step.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Usually people fear being overwhelmed with their suffering and try to run away or cover up their loneliness, their anger, their fear, their despair. We do anything to get busy, not to go home to ourselves and touch the suffering inside. But with the energy of mindfulness you can go home in strength. You can hold the suffering tenderly, like the mother holding her baby.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. I will try to breath and tenderly hold my emotional hurt like a baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Within us we carry the suffering of our father, of our mother, of our ancestors,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am definitely feeling the ancestors alive in me and motivated to stop this circuit I’m stuck in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is even more motivation for me. “Holding the suffering inside of us, we will come to understand the nature and the roots of that suffering. Understanding suffering always helps the energy of compassion to be born. And compassion is the kind of energy that can heal us and heal the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really worked it, and I think it took about 24 hours. I didn’t notice for a while that my angst had lifted; I did just feel lighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the key: You haven’t finished with your processing if you haven’t gotten to the point where you don’t want to punish anyone. Period. Never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh’s non-violence is so radical, it boggles the mind. But so does the reward: freedom, happiness, true love, nirvana. All these await us in the here and now, according to Nhat Hanh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, he says, “Nirvana isn’t on the way. It is the way.” And only as my time is winding up do I realize that is why it’s so affecting to be in his presence. Thich Nhat Hanh is teaching from his resting place in the here and now of nirvana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to keep working on that.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Dap di dap.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sitting here in this lovely room
Under the light of the big full moon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoying my time
I&amp;#39;ve got nothing to do
I&amp;#39;m hanging around
Just being with you
And awakening happens 
and I&amp;#39;m mindful &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m moving around on my feet
not going too fast
nobody to meet
I&amp;#39;d like to open my heart to you
I feel so happy 
just walking with you
And awakening happens
And I&amp;#39;m mindful &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chorus
How wonderful!
How wonderful!
Today we&amp;#39;re looking at the full full moon
and all that we can see 
is a fresh new plum plum tree&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a wonder-wonder-what a wonderful moon
What a wonderful night
Being here together just feels so right
We know that we are free
There&amp;#39;s no other place to be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bridge:]
Meditation is so good for me
Meditation gives me a path that sets me free&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dap di dap.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last week I had the great pleasure of being in St. Catharines, Ontario for a mindfulness retreat. This was led by the wonderful folk of Plum Village and dear Thây, Thich Nhat Hanh himself. (Thây is “teacher” in Vietnamese, and is what most people call Thich Nhat Hanh – which is nice because his name’s a bit of a mouthful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice of mindfulness is about being fully present in each moment. This is beyond carpe diem. It is about cultivating peace, understanding and compassion within (and for) yourself, in order to live peacefully with, and protect, all life (people, animals, plants and minerals). The main concept is that we cannot possibly be a positive force in the world if we are not first a positive force within ourselves. It makes a lot of sense to me. We cannot lend what we don’t have. In order to bring peace, we must be peace. If you look at the works of other big time peace activists (Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., Mother Teresa), they all say similar things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Fun fact, TNH was pals with Martin Luther King, Jr. and was instrumental in MLK’s stance on opposing the Vietnam War. MLK then nominated TNH for a Nobel Peace Prize).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, obviously if you are focusing on living peacefully and protecting all life, you have to take a clear look at your consumption patterns. The Big Ideas in Thây’s tradition are known as the “Five Mindfulness Trainings.” As Thây puts it, these are the Buddhist contribution to a global ethic. Honestly, they outline the type of living ideal for our beautiful, suffering, interconnected world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of these trainings in particular deal with the issues I’m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Second Mindfulness Training, True Happiness, says (in part):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aware of the suffering caused by exploitation, social injustice, stealing and oppression, I am committed to practicing generosity in my thinking, speaking and acting. I am determined not to steal and not to possess anything that should belong to others… I am aware that happiness depends on my mental attitude and not external conditions, and I can live happily in the present moment simply by remembering that I already have more than enough conditions to be happy. I am committed to working in a way that I can help reduce the suffering of living beings on Earth and reverse the process of global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard to argue with that. This is entirely in keeping with what I’ve been struggling toward. I also really appreciate the concept of not possessing things that should belong to others. I wonder what I possess that should not be mine…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fifth Mindfulness Training, Nourishment and Healing, says (in part):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful consumption, I am committed to cultivating good health, both physical and mental, for myself, my family and my society by practicing mindful eating, drinking and consuming… I am determined not to try to cover up loneliness, anxiety or other suffering by losing myself in consumption. I will make every effort to consume in a way that preserves peace, joy, and well-being in my body and mind, and in the collective body and mind of my family, my society and our Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, pretty straightforward. Though this training focuses more on what we eat, drink, watch, read and dwell on, it has implications for everything we consume. It also touches on the very serious problem of us using consumption as a way to cover up or push away our problems, rather than dealing with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was amazing to be among almost 1400 laypersons and about 50 monks and nuns who are all willing to deal with these issues together for the betterment of themselves and the betterment of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us all be mindful of our consumption. Why we are consuming, what we are consuming and how our consumption is affecting ourselves and every living thing on this planet.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Letter to the President of Vietnam&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honorable Mr. President Truong Tan Sang of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam&lt;/strong&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;Via the Ambassador of Vietnam in France&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RE: &lt;em&gt;Death Penalty in Vietnam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. President&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, the members of the Plum Village Community in France, including monastic and lay practitioners from many countries, are writing this letter with respect to you and the Vietnamese Government to make a request for a removal on the death penalty in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays in the world, there are many nations in which death penalty have been removed. As of 2010, only 21 nations still apply the rule of the penalty. By taking a prompt action, Mr. President, you will be able, first and foremost, to save the lives of 586 prisoners on death row. These individuals currently live with expectation of receiving a lethal injection, like Mr. Nguyen Anh Tuan who was so executed on the sixth of August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death penalty has not been proved to be an effective deterrent to crime. Out of compassion towards the nation, please intervene so that these prisoners on death row may have an opportunity to redeem themselves while they are in prison and become good citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the Ly Dynasty, death penalties such as being boiled in a cauldron of hot oil, being trampled upon by an elephant or being dragged by a horse were banned as our country came to embrace the teachings of the Buddha. In the time of the Buddha, Angulimala, a serial killer was granted amnesty by King Prasenajit, and he became one of the most compassionate people in the Sangha of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam agrees, we will send our monastic or lay Dharma instructors to prisons to guide incarcerated persons in the practice of mindfulness meditation and help them to transform and rediscover the joy of wholesome living—even while they are still in prison—as we and our friends have already and still conducted this in prisons all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are sharing this letter to friends in the religious and humanitarian communities worldwide. Many people will add their names to this request that you, Mr. President, use your considerable power so that now and in future many people may benefit from your compassionate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We respectfully express our gratitude to you, Mr. President, and we wish that you may have a long life in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act now:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thepetitionsite.com/435/099/051/banning-the-death-penalty-in-vietnam/&quot;&gt;Sign Petition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Dear Thay, dear Sangha, dear friends,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are very excited to be “Nourishing Great Togetherness”! To all of those attending the retreat at Brock University, we wish you all a happy closing to a wonderful past couple days. During the coming months, our N. American Sanghas will be blessed in sharing and practicing mindfulness as one and with teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh. We are also very grateful for the technology available to us to not only further our practice but to share, discuss, and celebrate with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/facebook-hashtag-150x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;Although the use of technology is not encouraged during tour events as it does not allow us to be fully present and in the moment, we offer an alternative way to become connected with our social media communities! After each tour event, we know our tech savvy attendees will have insights, photos, and updates they would like to share. In order to create a community of mindful interactiveness, we offer a hashtag (#) to be used on both Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By including this hashtag to your post, you will be adding to a larger “news feed” that features other posts relating to the tour. This way, you will be able to share and “Nourish Great Togetherness” via social media!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official hashtag for all posts (photos, status updates, and tweets) relating to Thich Nhat Hanh’s Tour of North America is ‪#‎TogethernessTour‬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all posts relating to Thich Nhat Hanh’s “Calligraphic Meditation: The Mindful Art of Thich Nhat Hanh” Exhibit, the official hashtag is ‪#‎PeaceIsEveryStep‬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to sharing in these two hashtags with you throughout the tour and exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bowing in Deep Gratitude,
Thich Nhat Hanh Foundation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the wonderful opportunity to photograph a dialogue between Thich Nhat Hanh and David Suzuki. Of course, I took many pictures of each of them, showing Thay&amp;#39;s gestures, expressions as well as his open and compassionate countenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part way through the discussion I became aware of the separate dialogue that was going on in Thay&amp;#39;s hands. His hands spoke to me of peace, conviction and true empathy, reinforcing his powerful words. By&lt;em&gt;Brian Kipp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

27th June, 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RE: &lt;em&gt;Bringing Mindfulness into Viet Nam’s Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Minister Phạm Vũ Luận,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a group of teachers, meditators and mindfulness practitioners working to bring mindfulness into the educational sector. We offer retreats and courses in Europe, America and Asia, to train educators and students in our integrated mindfulness training program which has been shown to increase effectiveness and wellbeing for individuals and school communities. Our largely Buddhist-based practices have been developed to meet the needs of 21st Century society in the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are interested to collaborate with Viet Nam, with teachers, schools, and education organizations; to see if we could introduce the mindfulness practices into the school curriculum of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Partners&lt;/strong&gt;
In the last 30 years, we have trained teachers in the US, the UK, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Thailand, India and Bhutan. In all these countries, schools, universities and governments are investing resources into the wellbeing and happiness of their teaching workforce, inspired by the example of Bhutan, where the welfare of its citizens, ecological sustainability and preservation of their culture goes hand in hand with economic development. We are confident that Vietnam and other ASEAN countries are also committed to going in this direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Programs&lt;/strong&gt;
Research has found that stress is an inhibitor of learning and growth. People, especially young people, need tools to handle their stress and strong emotions; they need to develop emotional resilience. At the same time, studies have also shown that happiness enables the student to flourish and be stable, emotionally and socially through school and beyond. Young people need to train themselves to discern when they have enough; to learn that happiness is a mental attitude and is not dependent on external or material conditions. Young people need to learn how to stop, relax and slow down, in order to be more lucid and effective. Our mindfulness training programs equip young people with these skills, while helping them develop their mental fitness, creativity, effectiveness, and teamwork skills. Many experts predict mental training will be as important as physical fitness in the next century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a teacher or a student can learn how to handle their strong emotions such as anger, sadness, or jealousy, it creates a positive and enjoyable learning environment in the classroom. Earlier this year we were invited by educators in Singapore and South Korea—countries that have been admired for the quality of their education system—to offer our integrated mindfulness training program. In our training sessions we saw how much teachers and students were in need of practical tools in order to handle the tension, stress and anxiety that come along with the pressure to succeed in a global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The countries we have been working with recognize that they need a global ethic to go along with their global economic progress; they recognize that the 21st Century is a century where interdependence is as important as independence. The progress of one nation, one people is no longer just an isolated matter in this era of globalization. They recognize they need to invest in a wisdom-based economy as well as a knowledge-based economy. Every country needs young people who are intellectually equipped to make good and wise choices throughout their lives that will make a positive contribution to their society, nation and environment. Education ministers in Thailand and Hong Kong, and leading education policy-makers in the US and UK have participated in our programs and have seen that our training responds concretely to these needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vietnam&lt;/strong&gt;
We recognize and applaud the steps Vietnam has taken to upgrade and improve her education system, so her teachers and students can be well-equipped to meet the demands and challenges of a modern economy. We know that you, as the Education Minister, are doing everything in your power so the young generation of Vietnam have the skills and qualifications they need to compete on the global stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country is looking to the West for this, yet we also recognize that Vietnam is infused with her own rich tradition, in which education is an essential and valued aspect of national culture. We know that in Vietnam the love and care (tình) between teacher and student is a precious and unique cultural heritage. In fact, it was not so long ago that families would visit the teacher&amp;#39;s home on TẾT New Year&amp;#39;s Day to pay respect and offer thanks for educating and cultivating their child&amp;#39;s mind; and that teaching, as a career was a well-respected and prized position in society. How many other countries have love songs that praise their teachers and express the care between teacher and student? Our program offers a way to integrate modern educational models with timeless values by introducing the mindfulness practices that help preserve and nurture love and care (tình) within the classroom and the whole school.

&lt;p&gt;Our training program has two different models: either a training conference for teachers and administrators from various institutions; or a training program in which the whole community of one school participates: teachers, students and parents alike. For example, in the UK we offered a 4-day training conference at the American School in London for 350 educators from around the world where teachers learned the practices to care for themselves and each other; and had opportunities to exchange ideas on ways to improve their classroom environment and the objectives education in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas, in India our team came in and over 7 days we offered dedicated mindfulness training sessions to teachers, students and then also parents; the entire school was able to experience the practice together for an extended period and to appreciate the benefits of the mindfulness practice in creating a calm and joyful atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to explore with you ways that we could collaborate in bringing the practices of mindfulness into the schools in Vietnam. Similar to the UK or India examples above, our team could offer a 3-6 day teacher&amp;#39;s training conference in Hanoi, Danang or HCMC; or a weeklong program for a model school in any of these cities as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we are delighted to be able to invite you as an honored guest to attend our upcoming 6 day training conference in Toronto, Canada August 11-16, 2013, titled “Happy Teachers Will Change the World”. We have reserved three spaces for you and two of your colleagues to participate and discover first hand with other teachers and people involved in education from around the world the benefits of our program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information can be found at the conference website: &lt;a href=&quot;http://tnhtoronto.ca/#The+Retreat&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tnhtoronto.ca/#The+Retreat&quot;&gt;http://tnhtoronto.ca/#The+Retreat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We are looking forward to your response and please feel free to contact our Wake Up Schools team for any clarifications at: appliedethics@eiab.eu.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Suffering Can Teach Us&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dharma Talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh on August 13, 1996 in Plum Village, France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;© Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear friends, today is the 13th of August, 1996, and we are in the Upper Hamlet. We are going to speak English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day after I spoke about the practice of the four mantras. I said that the fourth mantra is more difficult, so I did not talk about it. In fact it is difficult, but not so difficult. After the Dharma talk, when we were about to do walking meditation, there was a gentleman who stopped me on my way and asked me about the fourth mantra. He was very eager to learn and to practice the fourth mantra. He was very curious, because I had said that the fourth mantra is more difficult. But after that I thought it over, and I thought that the children are able to understand and practice the fourth mantra, also. So today I am going to tell them how to practice the fourth mantra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to practice the fourth mantra when you yourself suffer. Remember, the third mantra is to be practiced when the person you love suffers. You only need to go to him or to her with mindfulness, concentration, and you just proclaim the mantra: “Darling, I know you suffer. That is why I am here for you.” But this fourth mantra is practiced when you yourself suffer. You believe your suffering has been caused by the person you love the most. That is why it is so difficult. When the person you love so much says something or does something that hurts you, you suffer quite a lot. Because if it were another person who said something or did something, you would not suffer that much. But this is the person you love most in the world, and he just did that to you, he just said that to you. That is why you cannot bear it. You suffer one hundred times more. This is when the fourth mantra has to be practiced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to this practice, you have to go to that person, that very person, the person you love the most, who just hurt you very deeply. You go to him or to her with full awareness, with full mindfulness and concentration, and you utter the fourth mantra: “Darling, I suffer, please help.” This is quite difficult. But if you train yourself, you can do so. When you suffer and you believe that the person who makes you suffer is the person you love the most, you want to be alone. You want to lock your room, and cry alone. You don&amp;#39;t want to see him or her. You don&amp;#39;t want to talk to him or to her. You don&amp;#39;t want to be touched by him or her. Leave me alone! You don&amp;#39;t want him or her to touch you. This is very normal. It&amp;#39;s very human also. Even if the other person tries to approach and to reconcile, you are still very angry. You say: “Don&amp;#39;t touch me. Leave me alone. I don&amp;#39;t want to see you, to be with you.” That&amp;#39;s the real feeling at that moment. Very difficult. I think that you have had that experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is it possible to practice the fourth mantra? You go to him or her, and breathing in deeply, out deeply, become yourself one hundred percent and just open your mouth and say with all your might, your concentration, that you suffer and you need her help, his help. It seems that you don&amp;#39;t want to do so, because you don&amp;#39;t feel that you need his help or her help. You may need the help of all other people, but you don&amp;#39;t need his help. You want to be independent. “I don&amp;#39;t need you.” That&amp;#39;s what you want to say. That is the trouble; because you are deeply hurt. That&amp;#39;s why you cannot go to him and to her and ask for help. Your pride is deeply hurt. And that is why the fourth mantra is so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to practice this, we have to train ourselves for some time. Your natural tendency is to tell him or her that you can survive without him or her. You can be independent. You will not die because you lack his or her love. That is a natural tendency. But if you know how to look at the situation with wisdom, you see that this is a very, very unwise thing to do. Very stupid thing to do. Because when we love each other, we need each other, especially when we suffer. It would be unwise to do the opposite. You are very sure that your suffering comes from him or her; you are so sure. But maybe you are wrong. She has not done that, she has not said that, in order to hurt you, but you misunderstand. You have a wrong perception. Wrong perception is the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to tell you the story of Mr. Truong. It is a true story. It happened in my country many hundreds years ago. The people in my country all know about this story. There was a young man who was drafted into the army, so he had to go to the army and go to war. He had to leave his young wife home alone, pregnant. They cried quite a lot when they had to separate from each other. And they didn’t know whether the man would come back alive, because no one knows. To go to war is very risky. You may die in just a few weeks, or in a few months, or you may get badly wounded. Or if you have a lot of luck, you will survive the war and go home to your parents, your wife, your children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young man was lucky enough; he survived. A few years later, he was released from the army. His wife was so happy to learn the news that her husband was coming home. She went to the gate of the village to welcome her husband, and she was accompanied by her little boy. The little boy was born while his daddy was in the army. So the moment when they met each other again, they cried and embraced each other and there were tears of joy. They were very grateful that the young man had survived and come home. It was the first ti saw his little boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to tradition, we have to make an offering on the altar of the ancestors, to announce to ancestors that the family is reunified. He told his wife to go to the marketplace and buy flowers, fruits, and other provisions to make an offering to be placed on the altar. He took the little boy home, and he tried to persuade the little boy to call him daddy, but the little boy refused. “Mister, you are not my daddy. My daddy is another person. He used to come to visit us every night, and every time he came my mother would talk to him a lot, for a long time, and my mother used to cry and cry; and when my mother sits down, my daddy also sits down; when my mother lies down, he also lies down; so you are not my daddy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young father was very sad, very hurt. He imagined another man coming to his home every night and spending the night with his wife. All his happiness vanished just like that. Happiness was very short, followed by unhappiness. The young father suffered so much that his heart became a block of stone or ice. He could no longer smile. He became very silent. He suffered very deeply. His wife, shopping, did not know anything about it. So when she came home, she was very surprised. He did not look at her anymore. He did not talk to her anymore. He kept very cold, like he despised her. She did not understand. Why? She began to suffer herself, suffer deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the offering had been made, she placed it on the altar. Her husband burned the incense, prayed to the ancestors, spread the mat, made the four prostrations and announced that he was home, safe, with his family. You know, in my country, this is a very important practice. In every home, there is an altar for ancestors. On the altar you put the picture of one ancestor that represents all the ancestors. Maybe that is the grandma or the grandpa, and so on. Each morning, someone would come to the altar, wipe away the dust that had gathered on the table, light a stick of incense and bow, and offer that to all the ancestors. This is a very simple, but important practice every morning. So you always have incense sticks in the home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you come to the altar and light a stick of incense, you touch your ancestors. Touching your ancestors is a very deep practice. I don&amp;#39;t know whether our Western friends would like to practice this way, but if they do, they will have the chance to touch their ancestors every morning. Spiritual ancestors like Jesus, Buddha, the patriarchs, and the teachers. Blood ancestors like grandpa, great grandpa, great grandma, and so on. In Vietnam, this is a very popular practice. Every morning you light a stick of incense. You offer it to your spiritual ancestors and blood ancestors. You breathe in and out, and you touch your ancestors. This is very important, because if you get cut off from your ancestors, you will get sick, like a tree without roots. So I just propose this to you, to see whether it makes sense to set up a family ancestral altar in a European home or in a North American home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this practice can help us to get healthier, and bring harmony back into the family. Every time there is something happening in the family, you have to go and announce to your ancestors. This is our practice. It has been there for many thousands of years. If your little girl or little boy gets a strong fever, of course you need to ask a doctor to come and help, but you have to announce this to your ancestors. You have to light a stick of incense, come to the altar, offer it, breathe in and breathe out, and you have to announce to your ancestors that the little girl, the little boy, is has a fever. You have the duty of announcing this to your ancestors because they have the right to know, because that is their great, great granddaughter or son. If you are about to send your son to college, you also have to announce that to your ancestors. They have the right to know. Or if you are about to marry your daughter to someone in the next town, you have to announce that to your ancestors. That is the practice. That is why when the young man came home to be reunified with his family, they had to prepare an offering to be placed on the altar and announce that kind of return to the ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having offered incense, prayed and made four prostrations, the young father rolled up the mat and did not allow his wife to do the same, because he thought that his wife was not qualified to present herself in front of the ancestral altar. The young woman felt very ashamed—humiliated—because of that, and she suffered even more deeply. According to the tradition, after the ceremony has ended, they have to bring the offering down, and the family has to sit down and enjoy the meal with joy and happiness; but the young man did not do so. After the offering, he just left the house, went into the village, and spent his time in a liquor shop. The young man got drunk because he could not bear the suffering. In the old times, when they suffered so much, they used to go to the liquor shop and drink a lot of alcohol. Nowadays, people can use many kinds of drugs, but in the olden time alcohol was the only thing. He did not go home until very late, something like one or two o&amp;#39;clock in the morning, and he went home very drunk. He repeated that for many days: never talked to his wife, never looked at her, never ate at home, and the young lady suffered so much she could not bear it. On the fourth day, she jumped into the river and she died. She suffered very much. He also suffered very much. But no one was thinking of coming to the other person and asking for help, because pride—you have to call it by its true name, pride—was an obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you suffer, and you believe that your suffering has been caused by the person you love the most, you prefer to suffer alone. Pride prevents you going to the other person and asking for help. What if the husband had come to her? The situation might be very different. That night, he had to stay home because his wife was already dead, to take care of the little boy. He had to search for the kerosene lamp and he had to light it up. When the lamp was lighted up, suddenly the little boy shouted: “Here comes my father!” So he pointed to the shadow of his father on the wall. “You know, mister, my father used to come every night like this and my mother used to talk to him a lot and she cried a lot with him, and every time she sat down, my father also sat down. Every time my mother lay down, he also lay down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that his “father” was only the shadow of his mother. In fact, she used to talk to that shadow every night, because she missed her husband so much. One day the little boy had asked her: “Everyone in the village has a father, why don’t I have one?” So that night, in order to calm the little boy, she pointed to her shadow on the wall, and said, “Here is your father!” and she began to talk to the shadow. “My dear husband, you have been away for too long. How could I alone bring up our child? Please come back as soon as possible.” That&amp;#39;s the kind of talking she used to do. And of course, when she got tired, she sat down, and the shadow would sit down. Now the young father began to understand. A wrong perception was wiped away. But it was too late; the wife was already dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wrong perception can be the cause of a lot of suffering, and all of us are subjected to our wrong perceptions every day. That is what the Buddha said. We live with wrong perceptions every day. That is what the Buddha said. That is why we have to practice meditation and look deeply into the nature of our perceptions. Whenever we perceive anything, we have to ask the question, “Are you sure your perception is right?” To be safe, you have to ask, “Are you sure of your perceptions?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we stand there with friends, and look at the beautiful sunset, we enjoy the beautiful sunset, and we may be sure that the sun is setting, or has not set. But a scientist may tell us that the sun has already set eight minutes ago. The image of the sun we are touching is only the image of the sun eight minutes ago. He is telling the truth. Because it takes eight minutes for the image of the sun to come to us—that is the speed of light. We are very sure that we are seeing the sun in the present moment. That is one of the wrong perceptions. We are subjected to thousands of wrong perceptions like that in our daily life. It may be that the other person did not have the intention to hurt you, yet you believe that she has done that in order to punish you, to make you suffer, to destroy you. You carry with you a wrong perception like that, day and night, and you suffer terribly. Maybe you keep your perception until you die, with a lot of hatred toward a person who may be innocent. That is why meditating on perception is a very important practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the young man had gone to his wife and asked: “Darling, I have suffered so much in the last few days. I don’t think I can survive. Please help me. Please tell me who is that person who used to come every night, and that you talked cried to a lot, and every time you sat down he would sit down.” A very simple thing to do. Go to her and ask. If he had done so, the young lady would have had a chance to explain, and the tragedy would have ended. They would have recovered their happiness so easily, the direct way. But he did not do so because he was so deeply hurt, and pride has prevented him from going to her and asking for help. He had not learned the fourth mantra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the man committed that mistake, the woman also committed the same mistake. She also suffered so deeply, but was too proud to ask. She should have gone to him and asked: “Darling, I don&amp;#39;t understand. I suffer very much. I don&amp;#39;t understand why you don&amp;#39;t look at me, you don&amp;#39;t talk to me, you seem to despise me. You seem to feel that I am not there at all. Have I done anything wrong to deserve that kind of treatment?” That&amp;#39;s what she had to do. “Darling, I suffer. Please help.” That is the mantra. If she had done so, the young man, the young husband would have answered like this: “Why? Don&amp;#39;t you know why? Who is that person who used to come every night, and you talked to him?” Then she would have had the chance to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, after the young man found out his mistake, he cried and cried and cried. He pulled his hair. He beat his chest. But it was too late! Finally all the people in the village learned of the tragedy, they came and organized a big ceremony to pray for the poor lady. A ceremony of wiping out injustice committed by people like us, out of our ignorance and wrong perceptions. Together they built a shrine for her. That shrine still stands there. If you visit North Vietnam, going by that river you see that shrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 100 years later a Vietnamese king passed by and he asked: &amp;quot;What kind of shrine is that?&amp;quot; And they told him the story. He cried, and he wrote a poem. [Poem in Vietnamese for 55 seconds.] That is the poem written by the king, to honor the lady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have to learn from the suffering of the young couple. We should not make the same mistake. Next time, when you suffer, if you believe that your suffering has been caused by the person you love the most, you have to remember this story. You have to be very careful. You have to learn now to train yourself, to prepare for that time. In that moment, you&amp;#39;ll be able to practice the fourth mantra. Practice walking meditation. Practice sitting meditation. Practice breathing in and out mindfully to restore yourself. Then you go to him or to her and you practice the mantra. “Darling, I suffer so much. You are the person I love most in the world. Please help me.” Without pride. If you let your pride stand in between you and her or him, it means that your love is not really true love, because in true love there is no room for pride. If pride is still there, you know that you have to practice in order to transform your love into true love. The children are young, they have plenty of chance to learn and train themselves for the practice. I am confident that even if you are still young, if you get the teaching and if you practice right now, it will be very easy for you to practice later on, when you suffer because you think that the person you love the most has done that to you, has said that to you. This is the story about Mr. [ph: Tu]. And you may be interested in a translation of the poem I just read. And also the fourth mantra. I don&amp;#39;t think that you are going to use the fourth mantra often, but it is a very important mantra. Maybe you have to use it only once a year, or twice a year, but it is extremely important. So I want you to write it down, and keep it somewhere. And every time you suffer very much, please go and look for that mantra, and try to practice it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day, in the New Hamlet, I was asked by a friend about the meaning of the meditation on the image of Jesus on the cross. What is the meaning of that kind of practice, contemplating the image of Jesus on the cross? At first I thought the question should be addressed to teachers in the tradition. We have often heard that when you contemplate the image of Jesus dying on the cross, you remember the fact that Jesus suffered and died for us. In the Buddhist study and practice concerning suffering, we know that suffering can teach us, we can learn a lot from suffering. If we look deeply into the nature of suffering, we may get insight on how we can get out of our situation. That is why suffering, dukkha, has been called in Buddhism a holy truth. Suffering is holy, because the contemplation of suffering can bring about insight on how to get out of suffering and transform it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not know how to make use of suffering, if you do not know how to learn from the suffering, then suffering cannot be a holy truth. We can sink into the ocean of suffering, we can be overwhelmed by suffering, and suffering is not a holy truth; it is only something destructive. That is why contemplating on suffering is a very important practice in Buddhism. Contemplating suffering, you will know how that suffering has come to be, because everything is born from conditions. And the contemplation on the nature of suffering will bring us insight on how that suffering has come to be, and the conditions that have brought this suffering to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have a depression. We have to live with that depression right now. We may ask whether we are able to get out of that depression, make it go away, and the Buddha said yes. If you look deeply into the nature of your depression, you would know how it has come to you. You will look back and see how you have lived your life in the last six months or so, you will find out how that depression has come. When you have insight, you just decide not to feed your depression in the way you have done during the last six months. Then your depression will have to die or go away for lack of food, because everything needs food to survive, including your depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to contemplate the suffering that Jesus underwent on the cross, I would ask whether Jesus bears his suffering, the injustice that was forced on him, well. In this summer opening we have had a few Dharma talks on the topic of forbearance. We have learned that if our heart is big, and if we have a lot of peace and joy and love then it would not be difficult at all for us to bear some injustice that people inflict on us. But if we are full of pain, suffering, anger, hatred, then it will be very difficult for us to accept the injustice people inflict on us. So I would find out whether Jesus bears the injustice that was inflicted on him well, whether in his heart there was anger or hatred, whether he is trying to teach us how to learn from our suffering. The image of Jesus dying on the cross may be very instructive, very helpful to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also got a new insight. It was during a visit to MonbosMongose? that I made with a few young monks and nuns. We went into the church in Monbos, not very far from here, and we sat there for half an hour. During the time I sat there I contemplated Jesus on the cross, and I had the vision that Jesus should be presented in other forms, not only on the cross. We learned that Jesus had gone to the mountain and practiced meditation alone. During that time he spent on the mountain he may have been practicing walking meditation or sitting meditation. Our friends have to depict him in a sitting position or in walking meditation, radiating peace and stability. An artist within the church has to come forward and bring us these images of Jesus that convey stability, solidity, calm, peace, tolerance. That&amp;#39;s what we need. That&amp;#39;s what the young people in the church need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young people are looking for something like stability, like tolerance, like understanding, like love. Maybe they don&amp;#39;t need to contemplate a lot the image of Jesus dying on the cross, but they need a very refreshing image of Jesus Christ, doing walking meditation or sitting meditation or holding children and playing with children. I really think so. Now people are attracted to the image of the Buddha, because the Buddha was sitting in a very solid, calm way, radiating peace and happiness, a half-smile on his lips. That is what we are very hungry for. We are very hungry for stability, for peace, for solidity, for tranquility. Anyone living in our time will feel that. That&amp;#39;s what we need the most. And therefore the young people, when they go to church, they should be able to touch these elements embodied by the clergy and by the images, especially the image of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was young when he died, but not many people have tried to present him as having joy, vitality, peace. Jesus had a great vitality within himself. It was very active during the years of his teaching. He encountered many, many people. He helped so many people. And you know that when you are able to do something for people you get a lot of joy, of peace, of stability. That is why I try to speak for the young people. We need the image of Jesus smiling, sitting, walking, embodying the joy, the peace, the tranquility, the love. The young people need that image very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, during that question and answer session, there was one question about the necessity of expressing our emotions and anger. The friend who asked me that question began by saying that if he tries to be calm, his child continues to be nervous, but if he begins to shout then his child gets quiet and calm. I did not have the chance to address his question, this approach. I only told him “Well, you shout, and then your little boy gets calm and doesn’t disturb you anymore, and you believe that it works. But if you look deeply into it, maybe it would not work in the future. Because by shouting like that, your child may get an internal formation, a wound within himself. And later on maybe communication between you and him will become difficult.” So we cannot say that it works. It may work for one moment, but it may cause damage in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said that “when you shout, your shouting may come from love or might come from irritation. There is a difference.” When you shout with irritation in you, that will create some negative things in you and also in your child. You have to measure the consequence of that. You cannot say that because you shout like that he accepts to become calm for a moment and you think it&amp;#39;s a good way to proceed. There are many cases where a son or daughter cannot communicate to a father. Communication is just impossible, because maybe the father has been using his authority a little bit too much. The father has to learn how to deal with the little boy or the little girl as a friend. He needs to practice forbearance, patience. He needs to practice loving-kindness even with his little boy or little girl. He needs to learn how to manage his irritation, his anger. A lot of tragedy has resulted from the way fathers and mothers deal with their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When there is a fight between parents and children, the losers are very often the children, because the children don&amp;#39;t have the right to respond to their parents the way their parents do. They cannot use the same kind of language or reaction, because they are at the mercy of their parents—financially and in every aspect they have to depend on their parents. That is why, when their parents express their anger, the children have to receive the violence and they have no means to get it out—to express it, to transform it. If the parents don&amp;#39;t know how to transform their violence, then the children will not know how to transform theirs either, because they have not learned anything from their parents. When children have become victims of the violence brought on them by parents, they suffer, and they don&amp;#39;t know what to do. That violence within them becomes a poison that continues to kill them. If these young people try to kill themselves, it’s mostly because they want to retaliate against their parents. By killing themselves, they want to send a message to their parents: “You know, I am killing myself because of you. You have made me suffer so much, and this is the fruit of your behavior, your way of dealing with me.” So when a young man or young woman commits suicide, there is always that kind of message directed to parents or society or someone else, because the violence in him or her has no way to be transformed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bell]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us who sit here, we are at the same time children and parents. Even if we are still young, we can be already a big sister or a big brother, and already have to play the role of a parent. That is why we have to learn how to be children and to be parents at the same time. We have to learn how to manage, how to take care of the violence in us. The energy of violence, the energy of hatred and anger in us, is something that continues to destroy us, to shape our behavior. That is why we have to learn the practice of how to handle that negative energy and how to transform it. In the Buddhist teachings, it is clear that the practice of compassion and loving-kindness is the only antidote to violence, hatred, and anger. We have learned that compassion and loving-kindness cannot just be born like that, they need the practice in order to be born. That is the kind of energy that should be fabricated by us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice of generating that kind of energy that can transform violence and hatred in us is the practice of looking deeply. Only the practice of looking deeply can bring about acceptance and understanding and love. When you practice breathing in on your cushion and visualize that you are a five-year-old boy or a five-year-old girl, and invite that little boy or little girl to be with you, you might touch that little boy or little girl in you with compassion, because that little boy or girl did suffer during your time of childhood. Your father at some point may have shouted at you, believing that shouting was the best way to keep you calm. He did not know that shouting like that could open up a wound within your little heart. The heart of little boy, five years old, is very tender, very vulnerable. Parents should be aware of these things. When you look at your little boy with a stern look, that is enough to scare him, to create terror in him, and to create a wound within his tender heart. For you, it&amp;#39;s very normal that a father when irritated can shout and can look at his boy with such kind of eyes, but for a little boy of five years old, that may be too much. For a little girl five years old that may be too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So breathing in, I see myself as a five-year-old girl or five-year-old boy. And during the whole time of your in-breath, you allow that little boy or little girl to come back. He is still alive in you. I am sure. I know. The little girl, the little boy, is still alive very much, with very much the same kind of need and suffering. When he is there, she is there, you have to embrace him or her in your mindfulness. You have to say: “Darling, I know you are still there, and I am here for you.” The first mantra, the second mantra. Breathing out, I smile to that little boy who was me. That smile is already the smile of compassion. Because when you breathe in, you see yourself as a five-year-old boy or girl, very vulnerable, very fragile. That is why when you breath out, your heart is already filled with compassion, and you embrace that little boy or little girl with your energy of compassion. There is already understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness of breathing revives an image, helps you to look deeply into that image, and helps you to generate the energy of compassion with which you embrace him or her. That is very healing, and you may continue this for some time, maybe ten, fifteen minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have in my hut a picture of me taken when I was sixteen and a half, a young novice. Every time I look at that, I still feel a lot of compassion. He did not know his path yet. He didn&amp;#39;t know what difficulties were waiting for him, because I underwent a lot of difficulties, sufferings. So if you want to practice, you may like to use your family album, you may need a picture of you when you were five or four, and you generate compassion for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a young man who came to the Upper Hamlet, I think about eight or ten years ago, who was given that kind of practice because he hated his father. He could not bear the thought of thinking and writing a letter to his father. At that time all the monks and nuns and lay people received the assignment of writing a letter, a love letter, to his or her father or mother. For him, to write a letter to his mommy might be possible, but not to his daddy. Although his daddy already had passed away, he still could not reconcile with him. He just could not think of his father. He considered his father as the main source of his suffering. There are many men and women like that around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the week that followed, I gave him the other half of the exercise: “Breathing in, I see my father as a five-year-old boy. Breathing out, I smile to that five-year-old boy that my father was.” Maybe you have not had a chance to see your father as a little boy, but before he became an adult, he was a little boy. Very fragile. Very vulnerable, also. Suddenly, that fragile image of your father comes to you, and you see that he&amp;#39;s no different from you. He was also as vulnerable as you, as fragile as you. He may be a victim of your grandpa. Every time his father shouted at him, every time his father looked at him with a stern look, he got a wound in his heart, just like you. He did not know how to transform that, so he was repeating the same kind of thing with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what we call the wheel of samsara, the vicious circle transmitted from father to son, from son to grandson. The violence we received, we don&amp;#39;t know how to transform, and even if we hate our father, if we promised ourselves that when we grow up we will do entirely differently from our father, we will repeat the same. We will do exactly the way our father has done to us. That is the wheel of samsara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen many young men who are very determined that they will do the opposite of their father. But when they grow up, get married, and have children, they do exactly the same. The whole habit energy, the transmission, the samsara. So if you are touched by the Dharma, you have an instrument to cut through the wheel of samsara, you end the samsara, and you will not transmit that violence to the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Breathing in, I see my father as a five-year-old boy. Breathing out, I smile to my father as a five-year-old boy.” Vulnerable. Fragile. Fearful. That is the practice of looking deeply, because when you look like that, you see that the other person suffers like you, is also a victim like you. Suddenly the nectar of compassion is born in your heart. Suddenly you feel that you can breathe in and out again. The image of your father is no longer the same. He is now a little boy with a lot of suffering, a lot of fear, a lot of wounds within himself. You have suffered, that is why you can understand the suffering of someone else, and that someone else is your father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fathers always have the tendency to love and make their children happy. That tendency is deep, it is natural. But because they have not learned the way to love properly, the way to handle their violence and anger, they have not been able to express their true love, and they have inflicted a lot of suffering on their children. We cannot say that there is no love in them, we can only say that the love in them has no way to be expressed. If we can begin to understand this, our heart will begin to open, and suddenly we can breathe and we can survive, because a drop of the nectar of compassion is already born in our heart. We no longer want to blame, because we have touched his or her suffering. We know that he does not need punishment, he needs help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his lifetime, no one has been able to help him, to transform his violence and his anger. He has not had a teacher, a Dharma brother or sister; and if I had not had a teacher, a brother or sister in the Dharma, I would have done like him, you see. So no blaming is possible now. Only compassion is the answer. So suddenly, you are on your cushion, and you feel that you can breathe, you can survive. And you can continue to practice. “Breathing in, I see my father as a suffering child. Breathing out, I embrace my father with my compassionate smile.” This is very healing, very nourishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young man placed on his table a picture of his father. He had asked for a picture of his father to be sent from America. He placed that on his desk. Every time he went out of his room he stopped by the door, looked into his father’s eyes, and began to breathe in and out and visualize his father as a little boy. Every time he went into his room, he turned on the light on the table, looked at that picture, and practiced breathing in and out. A few weeks later, he was able to sit down and write a letter, the assignment. We call it a love letter, the first love letter. And he succeeded in writing the letter. Writing a letter like that untied a lot of bondage in him, because of the nectar of compassion that had been born in his heart. Your heart suddenly expands, there is now a lot of space, and now you can bear the injustice quite easily because you have an amount of understanding, of compassion that can digest, that can transform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the practice of looking deeply is the practice of expanding the heart, of putting more space and compassion into our heart. Bodhisattvas who have to bear a lot of injustice don&amp;#39;t have any hatred or anger in their heart. That is why they accept, they digest, injustice and suffering very quickly. In the Christian gospel you read: “Father, forgive them because they don&amp;#39;t know what they are doing.” They are doing that out of their ignorance. That is also good meditation, a good practice of looking deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the little boy held the two wings of the butterfly in two hands and tore the butterfly apart, he didn&amp;#39;t know what he was doing to the butterfly. He needs someone to tell him and to help him. I told him: “My dear, don&amp;#39;t you know that tonight the father and the mother of the butterfly will have to spend the whole night waiting for the butterfly to come home? Don&amp;#39;t you think that your parents would worry if you didn&amp;#39;t come home tonight? Please be kind to the butterfly.” The child understood right away. The next day when it was raining hard and a lot of snails were coming out on the path, he was picking up these snails with me and putting them back in the bush, saying we had to be careful, otherwise the snails could not go back to their parents that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So people are doing you injustice, are doing awful things to you and the people around. They may think that doing that is good. They don&amp;#39;t know what they are doing. They do it out of ignorance. And hatred, anger, jealousy, all these things are born from ignorance. That is what the Buddha said. So practicing looking deeply is to bring the kind of insight that will help us to understand, to accept, to love, to be compassionate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bell]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we have the energy of compassion in us, we can relate to the world very easily, because it is exactly that kind of energy that helps us to get out of our prison of loneliness. The people who have no compassion within their heart, they are very alone, because they have no ways to relate to other living beings. Having the energy of compassion in you, you are already a happy person. Every time you can do something to help another living being, the joy always returns to you. The teaching of love in Buddhism is quite clear. And also very deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our love is there for the other person or persons. But according to this teaching, you have to practice looking deeply into the nature of your love. And you can always improve the nature of your love. There are kinds of love that bring us a lot of sorrow, a lot of jealousy, a lot of hatred, a lot of suffering, because they are not true love. True love within the Buddhist teachings has to contain the element of loving-kindness. Maitri is loving-kindness and loving-kindness is the capacity of offering happiness. This is the process of learning, because to make the other person happy, you need to be there. You need to learn how to look at him or her. You need to learn how to talk to him or to her. Making another person happy is an art that we have to learn. It&amp;#39;s not because we bring him or her a lot of money that we can make him or her happy, but the way we live, the freshness we have, the tolerance we have. You are just there by his side or her side, and the other person enjoys your presence, enjoys your company, because your person contains loving-kindness, radiates loving-kindness. And whatever you do can bring him or her a lot of happiness. The word you say, a look you direct to that person, is enough to make him or her very happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the practice, you have to understand the real needs of that person, and again you have to practice looking deeply. If you do not know what the other person really needs, you will not be able to offer him or her happiness. And if you don&amp;#39;t have time, how can you look deeply into the other person? So take time, practice looking deeply into him or her, and see what kind of needs she has or he has, and just bring him or bring her the things they need. Maybe what they need is not a lot: your attention, your capacity of listening to him or to her, your capacity of talking to her in a nice way. Well, these things are very important, and maybe they just need these things to be really happy. You know that you can train yourself in order to be able to offer these kind of joys and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second element of true love is compassion, karuna. That is the capacity of removing the pain, transforming the pain in the person you love. Again, you have to practice looking deeply to see what kind of suffering that person has in him or her. Again, you see that you need to be really there in order to see. Your presence is necessary. Then, if you are mindful, you will know that the person you love suffers, and with some amount of looking deeply, you can identify the suffering in him or her. If you can look a little bit more deeply, you see the nature and the cause of that suffering. Only then can you practice compassion, karuna. If you don&amp;#39;t show that you understand that suffering, then you cannot practice karuna. You have to really understand that suffering, and sometimes you can stop the suffering just by the way you behave, talk, and act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you are the cause of that suffering. You have no capacity to listen deeply to that person. You have no capacity of talking to him or her in a calm and loving way; therefore, you cannot understand his or her suffering. Now, if you are able to train yourself and to practice loving speech and compassionate listening, you might by yourself transform the suffering in her or in him. That is true in most cases. That person might confront easily the other difficulties in life if she is supported by you, she is understood by you, she feels that you are on her side. That is compassion and compassion is the fruit of meditation, looking deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third element of true love is joy, mudita. There are those who love each other, but who cry every day, who make each other cry every day. It means that their love is not true love yet, because the element of joy is not there. True love must bring you joy and happiness, and not sorrow every day. If your love is possessive love, you may behave like a tyrant, a dictator, so you make the person you love suffer every day, you make each other suffer every day, because of your narrow ideas of happiness, your wrong perceptions. That is why your love is not true love yet. The practice of looking deeply will help you to be less possessive, more understanding, and therefore you can offer the other person joy every day. I have seen true love. I have seen people loving each other and offering each other joy every day, maybe every hour, every minute. It is not difficult. It is not difficult. With some mindfulness, with concentration, with some training, you can do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth and last element of true love is freedom, equanimity. If by loving, by being in love, you feel that you are losing your freedom, you have no space to move anymore, that&amp;#39;s not true love. That is why in true love you have to offer yourself and the other person space and freedom. You know that when you arrange flowers, you should allow each flower to have some space around it in order for the flower to radiate its beauty. A person is also a flower. If he is deprived of freedom, and then he will not feel happy; therefore love in such a way that you can retain your freedom and that person also can retain her or his freedom. And this is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a poem that I like about the moon. The refreshing moon, beautiful moon, is sailing through the ocean of the sky. The Buddha is the full moon that goes across the immense sky. If the river is calm, then the image of the moon will be reflected clearly in the river. Something like that. The image I like is the full moon traveling in the sky. You feel the freedom of the moon, because the moon has a lot of space around her. And the moon can benefit many people, can bring a lot of happiness to many people. It shines on everyone. It does not discriminate. It shines on the mountain and on the rivers. On this side of the frontier, on the other side of the frontier. That is equanimity. No discrimination. True love is upeksa, non-discrimination, and therefore no dictatorship.&lt;/p&gt;

Photo by Matthew Sherman[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we all know, traveling can be a tiring, stressful and disjointed experience. The core of our Plum Village practice is the experience of arriving in every step, of reaching our ultimate destination with each breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Denver International Airport in the United States, the artist Ximena Labra created an art installation entitled &amp;quot;To Those Who Go&amp;quot;, (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thosewhogo.net/the-project/&quot;&gt;http://www.thosewhogo.net/the-project/&lt;/a&gt;) which contains quotations about journeys, travel and arriving from great literature and spiritual teachers. One of the quotations on the wall is from our teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh. &amp;quot; I have arrived, I am here. My destination is in each step&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her own words, Ximena describes the project as: &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To those who go” is a public art project for those and about those who will travel. Not only in space and time, but also in their minds, those who travel are willing to go beyond their usual surroundings. They are the seekers. Therefore, they find. It is the will of discovery that makes us human beings find out who we are and what the universe is made of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a project about people who went and saw, the ones that have gone further and shared their discoveries, their dreams, their revelations. But it is also a project for the ones that are going today, -in spite of everything and because of everything the world is about- to find and to see, to do and to be… what they are.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A link to photos of the various quotations in the exhibit is available here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thosewhogo.net/images/&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thosewhogo.net/images/&quot;&gt;http://www.thosewhogo.net/images/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;The Art of Communicating&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/the-art-of-communicating.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/the-art-of-communicating-187x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In this book, The Art of Communicating, Thich Nhat Hanh states: ‘Loneliness is the suffering of our time. Even if we’re surrounded by others, we can feel very alone. We are lonely together.’ He explains how technology supplies us with many ways to help us stay connected – such as the Internet, e-mail, video conferencing, texting, posting, apps, letters and phones – yet our communications may be lacking in genuine meaning. Quite simply, many of us have forgotten how to connect with ourselves. And if we are out of touch with ourselves, how can we ever expect to communicate authentically with other people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ever, not only does Thich Nhat Hanh identify the problem; he offers solutions. He sets out the practical techniques of mindfulness to help us orientate ourselves in the present moment, to reach out to others and take responsibility for our thoughts and actions. ‘When you produce a thought, it bears your signature,’ he says. Communication isn’t static and our words, thoughts and physical actions will continue to have an impact on the future even after we are gone…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a time when it’s very easy to become caught up in a whirlwind of distractions – to pride ourselves on our number of ‘followers’, for instance, rather than our true friends and family – Thich Nhat Hanh’s is a calm voice, guiding us back to the real art of communicating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all of our best intentions, communication is still a challenge for most of us. How do we say what we mean in a way that the other person can really hear? How can we learn to listen with compassion and understanding? Why do people communicate so differently and how can we reach across our differences to strengthen our relationships?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using examples from his own experience working with couples, families, workplace colleagues, and international conflicts, celebrated spiritual leader Thich Nhat Hanh reveals five steps to truly mindful communication. By focusing on concrete and accessible practices, The Art of Communicating provides the key to communicating with yourself, loved ones, colleagues and new acquaintances more effectively, with kindness and mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘There is a saying in Vietnamese, ‘It doesn’t cost anything to have loving speech.’ We only need to choose our words carefully, and we can make other people happy. To use words mindfully, with loving kindness, is to practice generosity. We can make many people happy just by practicing loving speech.’ - Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Dharma Talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh on August 11, 1996 in Plum Village, France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;© Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is the eleventh of August 1996, we are in the Lower Hamlet, and our Dharma talk will be in English. Today we are going to learn the practice of the four mantras, because this is the kind of practice that I would like everyone to bring home and do every day. It’s very pleasant and it’s easy. A mantra is a magic formula. Every time you pronounce a mantra, you can transform the situation right away; you don’t have to wait. It is a magic formula you have to learn to recite when the time is appropriate. And the condition that makes it effective is your mindfulness, your concentration. It means that this mantra can only be recited when you are perfectly mindful and concentrated. Otherwise, it would not work. But you don’t need to be mindful or concentrated one hundred percent; even eighty percent can produce a miracle. And we all are capable of being mindful and concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mantra is “Darling, I am here for you.” I wish that children from Italy would practice it in Italian, French children would practice in French, Vietnamese in Vietnamese, and so on. We don’t have to practice it in Sanskrit or Tibetan. Why do we have to practice this mantra, “Darling, I am here for you?” Because when you love someone, you have to offer him or her the best you have. And the best that you can offer your beloved one is your true presence. Your true presence is very important to him or to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know a young man of eleven or twelve years old. One day his father asked him, “Tomorrow will be your birthday. What do you want? I’ll buy it for you.” The young man was not very excited. He knew that his father was a very rich person—the director of a large corporation—and he could afford to buy anything the young man wanted. He was extremely rich, so it was no problem at all to buy a birthday gift for his son. But the young man didn’t want anything. He was not very happy, and not because he did not have many things to play with. He was not happy because his father was not with him—he was always absent. He never spent enough time at home. He traveled like an arrow. And what the young man needed the most was the presence of his father. He had a father, but it did not seem very clear that he had a father, because the father was so busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know when someone is rich, he has try to work very hard in order to continue to be rich; that is the problem. Once you are rich, you cannot afford to be poor. That is why you have to use all your time and energy in order to work, work, work, day and night, in order to keep being rich. And I have seen many people like that. So the father does not have time for his children. Although the children in principle have a father, they don’t really have one. What they need the most is the presence of their father beside them. So the young man did not know what to say. But finally he got enlightened. He said, “Daddy, I know what I want.” “What?” And the father was waiting for an electric train, or something like that. The young man said, “I want you!” And it is very true, that children—if they don’t have their father or their mother beside them—are not very happy. So what they want the most is the presence of the person they love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you love someone, the most precious gift you can make to him or her is your true presence. That is why you have to practice in such a way that you are there. You are there one hundred percent and you look at him or her, and you say, “Darling, I am really here for you.” That is the greatest gift that we can make to our most beloved one. But this is not only a statement. You know a mantra is not a statement. A mantra is something you utter out of reality—that means you have to be there one hundred percent in order for what you say to become a true mantra. So in order to be really there you need one minute or two of practice—you breathe in: “Breathing in, I am calm, breathing out, I smile. Breathing in, I am really here, breathing out, I’m really here.” You do that a few times, and suddenly you are really there. It’s wonderful. You are not caught with your problems, you are not caught with your projects, you are not caught by the future, or by the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are really there, available, to the person you love. Then when you are sure that you are truly there—body and mind together—you go in the direction of the person you love, and looking at him or her mindfully, knowing that that person is really there and you are there, you smile and you say, “Darling, I am here for you, I am really here for you.” To many of us that is the greatest gift that we can make to our beloved one. If the father understood that, he would practice mindful breathing or walking for a few minutes, he would stop all his projects, he would cancel one of his meetings and just sit down, really close to his boy, and he would put his arm around the little boy, and look into the eyes of his boy and say, “Darling, this time I’m really here for you.” That is a very wonderful moment, that is a moment when life is really real and deep: father is there and son is there. Love is there because they are there for each other, they are available to each other. When you love someone, you have to make yourself available to the person you love. And this is the practice of meditation—to make yourself available one hundred percent as a gift to the person you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’d like the children to write that formula down on a sheet of paper in their own language, beautifully, and decorate it with flowers and fruits and birds. When you go home, you stick that mantra on your wall and you practice every day with the person you love. “Darling, I am really here for you,” that is the first mantra. My friends in America have painted that mantra on a tee-shirt. If you want, you might like to make a tee-shirt and paint that magic formula in Italian or French or German or Dutch. When you wear that tee-shirt, “Darling, I am here for you,” you might just look at that person and point to the mantra on your tee-shirt and smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second mantra is, “Darling, I know you are there, and I am very happy.” This is also a very easy mantra to practice. Because to love means to acknowledge the presence of the person you love. In order to acknowledge that he is there or she is there, you have to have the time. If you are too busy, how can you acknowledge his or her presence? And the most important condition for doing this mantra is that you be there one hundred percent. If you are not there one hundred percent, you cannot recognize his or her presence. When you are loved by someone, you need that person to recognize that you are there—whether you are very young or seventy years old or eighty years old, you still behave the same way. We always need the other person to acknowledge that we are here. We want to be embraced by his or her attention. Not only children need that but adults also need that. We need to be embraced by the energy of mindfulness of the other person. So if you are there one hundred percent and you go to the other person, you look at him or her, you smile and you say, “Darling, I know you are there and I am very happy.” That is to recognize the presence of the person you love and to say that you are very happy that she is still alive, available to us at any time. You know such a practice can make the other person very happy right away—you don’t need to wait five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the Buddhadharma—effective right away. If you are shy, you have to learn. You have to lock the door, turn the light off, and try to practice the mantra, “Darling, I know you are there, and I am very happy.” And when you are sure that you can do it, open the door and go to him or her and practice. You know, I practice that not only with people, but I practice that with the moon, the Morning Star, the magnolia flowers. Last year when I went to Korea, I was housed in a Protestant seminary and my little house was surrounded by magnolias, and it was springtime. The magnolia blossoms were very beautiful. They are a white color—like snow. I practiced walking meditation among the magnolia blossoms. I felt so happy, so wonderful. So I would stop and look closely at each magnolia flower. I smiled, breathed in and out and I said, “Darling, I know you are there, and I am very happy,” and I bowed to the flower. I was very happy, and I thought that the magnolia flower was happy also, because when people recognize your presence and appreciate your presence, you feel that you are worth something. Of course, the magnolia flowers were very, very precious to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I look at the full moon with mindfulness, I practice breathing in and out, and I tell the full moon the mantra: “Full moon, beautiful full moon, I know you are there, and I am very happy.” And I was really happy at that moment. I was a free person—I was not assailed by worries or fear or any projects. And because I was free, I was myself. I had the time and opportunity to touch the wonders of life around me, and that is why I could touch the full moon and I practiced the mantra with the full moon. This afternoon you might like to practice the mantra with somebody, or just practice the mantra with a tree or a butterfly, because they are all wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in the meditation hall and all of us can hear the sound of the rain. To me the sound of the rain is something wonderful. In the Upper Hamlet we have a veranda baptized the “listening-to-the-rain” veranda. If you are a free person you only need to sit there and listen to the rain, and you can be very happy already, because the rain is something wonderful. I very often think of the rain as bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara. After several weeks without rain, the vegetation begins to suffer and when the rain comes you can see that all the trees and bushes are very happy. I think they enjoy the sound of the rain, as I do, very much. Sitting in the meditation hall or sitting in the “listen-to-the-rain” veranda, you can appreciate the sound of the rain and you can be very happy just sitting there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So happiness is possible with mindfulness, because mindfulness helps us to realize what is there—so precious. Those of us who still have a mother, we should be happy. Those of us who still have a father, we should be happy. Those of us who still have eyes in good condition to be able to look at the moon, we should be happy. There are many things that can make us happy now. And that is the practice of mindfulness—namely, the practice of Buddhist meditation. So please write down the second mantra on another sheet of paper in your best handwriting, and decorate it with colors—with flowers, fruits, leaves, birds, and so on, and hang it in your room. I am certain that if you practice the first and the second mantra, you will make many people around you very happy. And don’t tell me that the practice is difficult—it is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bell]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third mantra is also easy to practice. You practice this mantra when you see that the person you love suffers. She is crying, or he is crying. Or if they are not crying, they look very unhappy. If you claim to be a lover, then you have to know what is happening to the person you love, and mindfulness helps you to notice that something is wrong within that person. Of course, if you are there one hundred percent for him or for her, you will notice very soon that the person you love suffers. If you don’t know that the person you love suffers, you are not mindful; you are not an ideal lover, because there is no mindfulness in you. Those of us who claim to be true lovers should practice mindfulness, we have to practice meditation, because how can you love if you are not there? You can only love when you are there and in order to be there you have to practice being there, whether by mindful breathing or mindful walking, or any kind of practice that can help you to be really there, as a free person, for the person you love. So because you are there, you are mindful—that is why you noticed that the person you love suffers. Right in that moment you have to practice deeply, to be there one hundred percent. You go to him or to her, and you pronounce the third mantra, “Darling, I know you suffer, that’s why I am here for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you suffer, you want the person you love to be aware of your suffering—that’s very human, that’s very natural. You suffer, and if the other person you love does not know that you suffer, if he ignores your suffering, you suffer much more. So it would be a great relief if the person we love knows, is aware, that we are suffering. Therefore your task, your practice as a lover is to come to him or her to offer your true presence and utter the third mantra, “Darling, I know you suffer, that is why I am here for you.” Before you can do anything to help, she suffers less already, because she knows that you are aware of her suffering. So the effect of the practice is instantaneous—quicker than if you make instant coffee—very quick. The more you are concentrated, the more you are mindfulness, the greater will be the effect of your practice. And children can practice this very well. Every time they see their brother or their sister suffer, every time they see Mommy crying, they should learn how to practice. They have to practice breathing in and out deeply and go to that person and take his hand or her hand and say, “Darling, I know you suffer and I’m here for you, really, I’m here for you.” This a great relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth mantra is only for adults because it’s a little bit complicated. This third mantra, also, I would like you to write down in English, Italian, or German in your best writing style—calligraphy—and you should decorate it with a lot of love and care. Make it into a masterpiece. And don’t wait until you are home to make it—I am asking you now to write down the three mantras here and decorate them very beautifully. When you go home, put them on the wall of your room or maybe in the living room—it’s up to you. But my expectation is that you be able to practice them. And this is not the practice of children alone, this is the practice of everyone. Even if she is seventy or eighty, she still can practice; even if he is eighty he still can practice them and this can make a lot of happiness in the house. You try a few weeks, and you’ll see—the situation in the home will be transformed very drastically. Communication is restored. We are concerned with the happiness and the sorrow and the suffering of every other member in the family. And of course this practice is easy, simple, and everyone can do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when you hear the small bell, please stand up and bow to the Sangha before you go out. [Bell—children leave] In the time of the Buddha there was a lay person whose name was Anathapindika. His real name was Sudatta. Anathapindika was a name given to him by the people in the city because they loved him. He had a good heart. He was a rich tradesman, business man, but he spent a lot of his time and money taking care of poor people, people who were abandoned, children, orphans, and so on. That is why the title “Anathapindika” was given to him by the people of his city Shravasti—it means “the person who takes care of the isolated ones, the unhappy ones,” and so on. It was he who invited the Buddha to come and teach in his country. The Buddha before that stayed in the country of Magadha. Anathapindika during one of his trips to Magadha found out about the presence of the Buddha. He was very greatly inspired by the teaching of the Buddha, that is why he invited the Buddha to his country, Kosala. And it is he who purchased the most beautiful park close to the city of Shravasti and offered it to the Buddha as a monastery—the first monastery in that country. Later on, it was called the Jeta Park, because the owner of the park had been the prince, whose name was Jeta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anathapindika took great pleasure in serving the Buddha and the Sangha, and his family was a happy family because his wife and all the three children followed the teaching of the Buddha. But he was not given all the teachings of the Buddha, because at that time people thought that lay people were too busy and should receive only the kind of teachings they could afford to do. So the deepest kind of teachings were only given to monks and nuns. It was Anathapindika who made it clear to the monks and nuns that there were lay people who were very capable of practicing the deepest teachings of the Buddha, and he said, “Please, Venerables, go back and tell the Lord that there are many lay people who are too busy and who cannot afford to learn and practice the deeper teaching of the Buddha, but there are among lay people those who are very capable of learning the practice and these teachings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anathapindika was very sick, he was about to die—this was after serving the Buddha for about thirty years. The Buddha went to him and visited with him, and after that he charged the Venerable Shariputra—one of his best disciples—to take care of Anathapindika. And one day Shariputra learned that Anathapindika was extremely sick—he might pass away at any time—so he went to the room of his younger brother in the Dharma, the Venerable Ananda, and asked him to come along for a visit. So both of them went to the house of Anathapindika.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Anathapindika saw both of them coming, he was very glad. He tried to sit up but he was too weak; he could not. Shariputra said, “My friend, just remain where you are. You don’t have to try hard to sit up, we will bring a few chairs and sit next to you.” And after having said that, Shariputra asked, “Dear friend, Anathapindika, how do you feel in your body? Is the pain in your body increasing or decreasing?” And Anathapindika said, “Venerables, the pain in me is increasing all the time; I suffer very much, it does not decrease.” And when Shariputra heard that he said, “Why don’t we practice meditation on the Three Jewels? Let us practice breathing in and out and focus our attention on the wonderful Buddha, the wonderful Dharma, and the wonderful Sangha.” And he offered guided meditation to Anathapindika and both of the monks also sat there and practiced together with the lay person who was dying. So, two monks supported a lay person practicing in this very crucial moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shariputra was an extremely intelligent person. He was like the right hand of the Buddha, taking care of the community of monks, teaching many of them as a big brother, and he knew exactly what the dying Anathapindika needed. So he offered first of all meditation on the Three Jewels, because he knew very well that the greatest joy of Anathapindika was to serve the Buddha and the Sangha. He did everything to make the Buddha comfortable and the Sangha comfortable. Therefore meditating on the Buddha, on the Sangha, would bring joy and happiness that would counterbalance the pain in the body. All of us have to learn this, because in us there are seeds of suffering, there are seeds of joy. If you know how to touch the seeds of joy, they will be watered and the energy of happiness and joy will be strong enough to counterbalance—to make the person suffer less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddha is the one who has the capacity of being there, of being mindful, of being understanding, of being able to love and accept, of being joyful. There are the ten titles of the Buddha that people would repeat in order to touch those qualities—the joy and the peace of the Buddha. After meditating on the Buddha, they meditated on the Dharma. The Dharma is a path that can bring relief and joy and peace to us right away—we don’t need to wait. The Dharma is not a promise of happiness in the future. The practice of the Dharma is not a matter of time—as soon as you embrace the Dharma and practice, you begin to get relief and transformation right away. And the Sangha is composed of members who practice concentration, mindfulness, wisdom, joy, and peace. To let your mind touch these wonderful jewels—that can water the seed of happiness in you. After about ten minutes of practicing like that, Anathapindika felt much better already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time when you sit close to a dying person, you might like to practice this same way. You are there, present one hundred percent, with stability, solidity, and peace. This is very important. You are the support of that dying person, and he or she needs very much your stability, your peace. To accompany a dying person, you need to be your best—don’t wait until that moment to practice. You practice in your daily life to cultivate your peace, your solidity. Then you look into the person and you recognize the seeds of happiness that are buried deep in him or her, and you just water these seeds. Everyone has seeds of happiness. We should know in advance. And at that moment you talk to him or to her, you use guided meditation, in order to help him or her touch the seeds of happiness within him or her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago I was on my way to lead a retreat in the northern part of New York state, and I learned that our friend Alfred Hassler was dying in a Catholic hospital nearby. So we managed to stop and spend some time with him. Alfred was very active during the Vietnam war. He was director of the Fellowship of Reconciliation in New York, and he supported us wholeheartedly in bringing the message of peace from the Vietnamese people, and he worked very hard to get a cease-fire and a negotiation between the warring parties. He was dying there, and I and Sister Chân Không and about six or seven of us were in a limousine, and we arranged so that we could stop. Only Sister Chân Không and I were allowed to go in; the rest were waiting in the car. When we arrived, Alfred was in a coma and Laura, his daughter, was trying to call him back, “Alfred, Alfred, Thây is here, Sister Chân Không is here!” But he didn’t come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Sister Chân Không to sing him a song—the song was written by me and the words are taken directly from the Samyutta Nikaya: “These eyes are not me, I am not caught in these eyes. I am life without boundaries, I have never been born, I will never die. Look at me, smile to me, take my hand. We say goodbye now, but we’ll see each other right after now. And we’ll meet each other on every walk of life.” Sister Chân Không began to sing softly that song. You might think that if Alfred was in a coma, he could not hear. But you must not be too sure, because after singing two or three times softly like that, Alfred came back to himself—he woke up. So you can talk to a person who is in a coma. Don’t be discouraged, talk to him or to her as if he is awake. There is a way of communicating. We were very happy that he recovered his consciousness and Laura said, “Alfred, you know that Thây is here with you, Sister Chân Không is here with you.” Alfred was not able to speak. He was fed with glucose and things like that. He could not say any word, but his eyes proved that he was aware that we were there. I massaged his feet and I asked whether he was aware of the touch of my massage. When Laura asked, his eyes responded that he was aware that I was massaging his feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are dying, you may have a very vague feeling of your body; you don’t know whether exactly your body is there. So if someone rubs or massages your arms or feet, that will help, that will reestablish a kind of contact and awareness that the body is still there. Sister Chân Không began to practice exactly like Shariputra; she began to water the seeds of happiness in Alfred. Although Alfred had not spent his time serving the Buddha, the Sangha, he had spent a lot of his time working for peace. So Sister Chân Không was watering the seeds of peace work in him. “Alfred do you remember the time you were in Saigon and were waiting to see the superior monk Tri Quang? Because of the American bombing, Tri Quang was not willing to see any Westerners. And you had a letter from Thây and you wanted to deliver it to Tri Quang? You were not allowed to get in, so you sat down, outside his door, and you slipped under his door a message that you were going to observe a fast until the door was opened, and you did not have to wait long because just ten minutes after that, Tri Quang opened his door and invited you in? Do you remember that, Alfred?” And she tried to refresh the memories of these happy events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alfred, do you remember that event in Rome where three hundred Catholic monks were demonstrating for peace in Vietnam? Each of them wore the name of a Buddhist monk in prison in Vietnam—because these Buddhist monks refused to be drafted into the army and obey the law of the army. Over here we tried our best to make their suffering known. So in Rome, three hundred Catholic priests wearing the names of three hundred Buddhist monks in jail in Vietnam made a parade, do you remember that?” All these kinds of memories came back to him. Sister Chân Không continued to practice, exactly like Shariputra. At one point, Alfred opened his mouth and spoke. He said, “Wonderful, wonderful,” two times, and that is all. One or two minutes later he sunk again into his coma and never came back again. Six people were waiting in the limousine and that night we had to give an orientation talk to four or five hundred retreatants, so I recommended to Laura and to Dorothy, his wife, that if he came back, they should continue the same kind of practice: massaging and watering the seeds of happiness in him. And we left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bell]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early morning of the next day we got a telephone call that Alfred died very peacefully, just one hour or an hour and a half after we had left. It looks like he was waiting for us, and after that kind of meeting he was completely satisfied and he died in peace. When Sister Chân Không’s big sister was dying in California, she was suffering a lot in her body. In the hospital she was in a coma, but she suffered very much in her body; and she cried and she shouted, and all her children did not know what to do, because they had not learned anything from the Dharma yet. When Sister Chân Không came in and saw that, she began to chant. But her chanting was a little bit too weak compared with the moaning and crying of the person who was dying. So Sister Chân Không used a cassette recorder and a tape of the kind of chanting that you heard this morning, “Namo Avalokiteshvaraya, bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara.” She used an earphone and she turned the volume quite high. In just a few minutes, all the agitation, all the suffering, all the crying stopped, and from that moment until she died, she remained very quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was like a miracle, and all of her children did not understand why, but we understand. Because she also had the seed of the Buddha-dharma in her, she had heard the chanting, she had had contact with the practice—the chanting, the atmosphere of the practice. But because of having lived too many years in an environment where the atmosphere of calm, of peace, was not available, many layers of suffering had covered it up, and now the chanting helped her although she was in a coma. The sound broke through and helped her touch what was deep in her. Because of that miracle of linking with the seed of peace and calm within her, she was able to quiet all her agitation and crying and she stayed very calm until she died. So every one of us has that kind of seed in us—seeds of happiness, seeds of peace and calm. If we know how to touch them, we can help a dying person to die peacefully. We have to be our best during that time—we have to be calm, solid, peaceful, and present in order to help a person dying. The Buddhist practice of touching the Ultimate should be practiced in our daily life—we should not wait until we are about to die in order to practice. Because if we know how to practice touching deeply the phenomenal world in our daily life, we are able to touch the world of the Absolute, the ultimate dimension of reality in our daily life. When you drink your cup of tea, when you look at the full moon, when you hold the hand of a baby, or walk with a child, if you do it very deeply, mindfully, with concentration, you are able to touch the ultimate dimension of reality, and this is the cream of the Buddhist teaching—touching the Ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day we talked about the wave, living the life of a wave, but at the same time she can also live the life of water within her. She does not have to die in order to become water, because the wave is water already in the present moment. Each of us has our ultimate dimension—you may call it “the kingdom of God,” or nirvana, or anything. But that is our ultimate dimension—the ultimate dimension of our reality. If in our daily life we live superficially, we cannot touch it. But if we learn how to live our daily life deeply, we’ll be able to touch nirvana—the world of no birth and no death—right in the here and the now. That is the secret of the practice that can help us transcend the fear of birth and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having guided Anathapindika to practice watering the seeds of happiness in him, the Venerable Shariputra continued with the practice of looking deeply: “Dear friend Anathapindika, now it is the time to practice the meditation on the six sense bases. Breathe in and practice with me, breathe out and practice with me. These eyes are not me, I am not caught in these eyes. This body is not me, I am not caught in this body. I am life without boundaries. The decaying of this body does not mean the end of me. I am not limited to this body.” So they continued to practice, in order to abandon the idea that we are this body, we are these eyes, we are this nose, we are this tongue, we are this mind. They meditated also on the objects of the six senses: “Forms are not me, sounds are not me, smells are not me, tastes are not me, contacts with the body are not me; I am not caught in these contacts with the body. These thoughts are not me, these notions are not me, I am not caught in these thoughts and in these notions.” And they meditated on the six consciousnesses: sight, hearing, consciousness based on nose, consciousness based on tongue, consciousness based on body, consciousness based on mind: “I am not caught in consciousness based on the body. I am not caught in consciousness based on the mind.” June 23, 1997: Had to do some rearranging here to separate out the six sense bases, the objects, and the consciousnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having guided Anathapindika to practice watering the seeds of happiness in him, the Venerable Shariputra continued with the practice of looking deeply: “Dear friend Anathapindika, now it is the time to practice the meditation on the six sense bases. Breathe in and practice with me, breathe out and practice with me. These eyes are not me, I am not caught in these eyes. This body is not me, I am not caught in this body. I am life without boundaries. The decaying of this body does not mean the end of me. I am not limited to this body. These thoughts are not me, these notions are not me, I am not caught in these thoughts and in these notions.” So they continued to practice, not in order to abandon the idea that we are this body, we are these eyes, we are this nose, we are this tongue, we are this mind, and also the objects of this six sense basis—sight, hearing, consciousness based on nose, consciousness based on tongue, consciousness based on body, consciousness based on mind. “Forms are not me, sounds are not me, smells are not me, tastes are not me, contacts with the body are not me; I am not caught in these contacts with the body.” Then they meditated on the six elements: “The element of earth in me is not me, I am not caught in the earth element. The element of water in me is not me, I am not caught in the element of water.” Then they went on with the elements of air, space, fire, and consciousness. Finally they came to the meditation of being and non-being, coming and going. “Dear friend Anathapindika, everything that is arises because of causes and conditions. Everything that is has the nature not to be born and not to die, not to arrive and not to depart.” When we look at this sheet of paper, you might think that there is a moment when the sheet of paper began to be and there will be a moment when this sheet of paper will stop being. Sentence out: They were meditating on being and non-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think that before we were born we did not exist, and we think that after we die we might become nothing. Because in our mind we have the idea that to be born means “from nothing we suddenly become something.” From no one you suddenly become someone—that is our notion of birth. But how is it possible that from nothing something could become something, from no one they could become someone? That is very absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at this sheet of paper—we may think that the moment of its birth is when the paste was made into this sheet of paper. But this sheet of paper was not born out of nothing! If we look deeply into this piece of paper, we see already that it had been there before its “birth” in the form of a tree, in the form of water, in the form of sunshine, because with the practice of looking deeply we can see the forest, the earth, the sunshine, the rain—everything in there. So the so-called “birthday” of the sheet of paper is only a “continuation day.” The sheet of paper had been there for a long time in various forms. The “birth” of the sheet of paper is only a continuation. We should not be fooled by the appearance. We know that the sheet of paper has never been born, really. It has been there, because the sheet of paper has not come from nothing. From nothing, you suddenly become something? From no one, you suddenly become someone? That is very absurd. Nothing can be like that. So the day of our birth is only a continuation day and practicing meditation is to look deeply into ourselves to see our true nature. That means, our true nature is the nature of no birth and no death. No birth is our true nature. We used to think that to be born means from nothing we become something. That idea, that notion is wrong, because you cannot demonstrate that fact. Not only this sheet of paper, but that flower, this book, this thermos, they were something else before they were “born.” So nothing is born from nothing. The French scientist Lavoisier said, “Rien ne se crée,”nothing is produced. There is no birth. The scientist is not a teacher of Buddhism, but he made a sentence exactly with the same kind of words that are found in the Heart Sutra. “Rien ne se crée, rien ne se perd,” nothing is produced, nothing dies.Left out here: And the same truth is spoken from the mouth of a scientist. Let us try to burn this sheet of paper to see whether we can reduce it into nothing. Maybe you have a match or something? Be mindful and observe. . . . We know that it is impossible to reduce anything into nothing. You have noticed the smoke that came up. Where is it now? Part of the sheet of paper has become smoke, it has joined a cloud. We may see it again tomorrow in the form of a raindrop. That’s the true nature of the sheet of paper. It is very hard for us to catch the coming and the going of a sheet of paper. We recognize that part of the paper is still there, somewhere in the sky in the form of a little cloud. So we can say, “So long, goodbye, see you again tomorrow.” I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;t’s hot when I burn it—I got a lot of heat on my fingers. The heat that was produced by the burning has penetrated into my body and into yours also. It has come into the cosmos, and if you have a very sophisticated instrument, you can measure the effect of that heat on everything, even several kilometers from here. So that is another direction where the sheet of paper has gone. It is still there, in us and around us. We don’t need a long time to see it again. It may be already in our blood. And this ash, the young monk may return it to the soil and maybe next year when you try a piece of lettuce, it is the continuation of this ash. So it is clear that you cannot reduce anything to nothing, and yet we continue to think that to die means from something you become nothing, from someone you just become no one. Is it possible? So the statement, “Rien ne se crée, rien ne se perd,” nothing is really born, nothing can die, goes perfectly with the teaching of the Buddha on the nature of no birth, and no death. Our fear is born from notions—the notions of being and non-being, the notions of birth and death. Before we were born we are taught that that was “non-being,” after we are born we believe that that is “being,” and after we die we think that that will be “non-being” again. So not only do the notions of birth and death imprison us in our fear but the notions of being and non-being have to be transcended. That is the cream of the Buddhist teaching—to silence all the notions and ideas, including notions of birth and death, being and non-being. What is Nirvana? Nirvana is the blowing out of all notions, the notions that serve as the foundation of fear and suffering. The other day we were dealing with the notion of happiness. Even the notion of happiness can make us miserable, can create a lot of misery for us. That is one of the notions that should be transcended. There are basic notions that are the foundation of our fear and suffering: the notions of being and non-being, birth and death, coming and going. From where have you come and where shall we go? The idea of coming and going is also a notion that we have to transcend.Left out: The notion of one the same are the different.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bell]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the guided meditation given to Anathapindika by Shariputra: Everything that is has the nature not to be born and not to die. No birth and no death. Not to arrive and not to depart. No coming, no going. When the body arises, it arises; it does not come from anywhere. When the body ceases, it ceases; it does not go anywhere. The body is not nonexistent before it arises. The body is not existent after it arises. Left out: It’s not because of the manifestation of the body that you can perceive the body and you think that the body is. It’s not because you cannot perceive the body that you can qualify it as non-being. When conditions are sufficient there is a manifestation, and if you perceive that manifestation, you qualify it as being. If conditions are no longer sufficient, you cannot perceive it, and you qualify it as non-being. You are caught in these two notions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like if you come to Plum Village in April and you look, you see no sunflowers. Looking around you say that there are no sunflowers around here. That is not true. The sunflower seeds have been sown. Everything is ready by that time. Only the farmers and their friends, when they look at the hills around Plum Village, already can see sunflowers. But you are not used to it—you have to wait until the month of July in order to recognize, to perceive sunflowers. So if out of your perception, you qualify it as “being” or “non-being”—well, you miss the reality. Not being perceived by you doesn’t make it non-being, nonexistent. Just because you can perceive it, doesn’t mean that you can qualify it as existing and being. It is a matter of causes and conditions. If conditions are sufficient, then it is apparent, and you can perceive it; and because of that, you say that it “is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why, in deep meditation, we have to transcend all these ideas, all these notions, and we can see what other people cannot see. Looking into the flower you can see the garbage, you can see the cloud, you can see the soil, you can see the sunshine. Without much effort, you can see that a flower “inter-is” with everything else, including the sunshine and the cloud. We know that if we take away the sunshine or the cloud, the flower will be impossible. The flower is there because conditions are sufficient for it to be; we perceive it and we say, “Flower exists.” And when these conditions have not come together, and you don’t perceive it, and then you say, “It’s not there.” So we are caught by our notions of being and non-being. The ultimate dimension of our reality cannot be expressed in terms of being and non-being, birth and death, coming and going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is like the water that is the substance of the waves. Talking about the wave, you can speak of the “birth” of a wave, the “death” of a wave. The wave can be “high” or “low,” “this” or “other,” “more” or “less” beautiful: but all these notions and terms cannot be applied to water, because the water is the other dimension of the waves. So the ultimate dimension of our reality is in us, and if we can touch it, we’ll transcend the fear of being and non-being, birth and death, coming and going. For Buddhist meditators, “to be or not to be,” that is not the question! Because they are capable of touching the reality of no birth and no death; no being, no non-being. You have to transcend both concepts—being and non-being—because these concepts constitute the foundation of your fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be a pity if we practiced only to get the relative kind of relief. The greatest relief is possible only when you touch nirvana. Nirvana means the ultimate dimension of our being, in which there is no birth, no death, no being, no non-being. All these notions are entirely removed. That is why nirvana means “extinction”—the extinction of all notions and concepts, and also the extinction of all suffering that is born from these concepts, like fear, like worries. When we begin to touch the phenomenal world, we see there is birth, there is death, there is impermanence, there is no-self. But as we begin to touch profoundly the world of phenomena, we find out that the base of everything is nirvana. Not only are things impermanent, but they are permanent as well. You transcend the idea of permanence, and you also transcend the idea of impermanence. Impermanence is given as an antidote so that you can release your notion of permanence. And since you are caught by the idea of self, no-self is a device to help you to get release from the notion of self. Touching the Absolute, not only can you release the notion of self, but you can also release the notion of non-self. If you have a notion of nirvana, please do your best to release it as soon as possible—because nirvana is the release of all notions, including the notion of nirvana!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anathapindika was a very able practitioner. When he practiced to this point, he was so moved that he got insight right away. He was able to touch the dimension of no-birth and no-death. He was released from the idea that he is this body. He released the notions of birth and death, the notions of being and non-being, and suddenly he got the non-fear. The Venerable Ananda saw him crying because of happiness, because of that kind of release. But Ananda did not understand what was really happening with the lay person Anathapindika, so he said, “Why, dear friend, why are you crying? Do you regret something, or did you fail in your practice of the meditation?” He was very concerned. But Anathapindika said, “Lord Ananda, I don’t regret anything. I practiced very successfully.” Then Ananda asked, “Why are you crying, then?” Anathapindika said, “Venerable Ananda, I cry because I am so moved. I have served the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha for more than thirty years, and yet I have not received any teaching that is deep like today. I am so happy to have received and practiced this teaching.” And Ananda said, “Dear friend, this kind of teaching we monks and nuns will receive every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that Ananda was much younger than Shariputra. Thereupon Anathapindika said, “Venerable Ananda, please go home and tell the Lord that there are lay people who are so busy that they cannot receive this kind of deep teaching, but there are those of us, although lay people, who do have the time, the intelligence, and the capacity of receiving this kind of teaching and practice.” And those were the last words uttered by the lay person Anathapindika. The Venerable Ananda promised to go back to the Jeta grove and report that to the Buddha, and it is reported in the sutra that not long after the departure of the two monks, the layman Anathapindika died peacefully and happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a sutra, a discourse called “The Teachings to be Given to the Sick.” You can find it in the Plum Village Chanting Book, in English. We are working on a new version of the Plum Village Chanting Book, but in the present edition you already have this text. This text is available in Pali, in Chinese, and we have several other texts which offer the same kind of teaching. So I would recommend that we study this text and we do a Dharma discussion in order to deepen our understanding of the teaching, and how to put into practice this teaching of the Buddha in the best way possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a psychotherapist, if you are a social worker, if you are the one who has to help a dying person, it’s very crucial that you study this kind of teaching and put it into your practice in your daily life. And if you are simply a meditator who would like to deepen your practice, cut: who wants to get rid of your fear, your lack of stability, your anger, then the study and practice of this sutra will help you to get more stability, get more peace, and especially the ground of non-fear, so that when the moment comes, you can confront it in a very calm and easy way—because all of us are supposed to die some day. Even if theoretically in the teaching there is no birth and no death, if we are able to live our daily life in such a way that we could touch the ultimate dimension, then that moment will not be a problem for us at all. In my daily life I always practice looking at things around me, at people around me, at myself; and I can already see my continuation in this flower, or that bush, or that young monk, or that young nun or that young lay person. I see that we belong to the same reality, we are doing our best as a Sangha, we bring the seeds of the Dharma a little bit everywhere, we make people around us happy: so I don’t see the reason why I have to die, because I can see myself in you, in other people, in many generations. That is why I have promised the children that I will be climbing the hill of the twenty-first century with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the top of the hill in the year 2050, I’ll be looking down and enjoying what is there together with the young people now. The young monk Phap Canh is now twenty-one, and on the top of the hill he will be seventy-five! And of course I will be with him, hand in hand, and we will look down together to see the landscape of the twenty-first century. So as a Sangha, we shall climb the hill of the twenty-first century together. We’ll do our best so that the climbing will be enjoyable and peaceful, and we’ll have all the children with us because we know that we never die. We will be there for them forever.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Mara and the Buddha – Embracing our Suffering&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear friends, today is the 6th of August, 1996 and we are in the Upper Hamlet. We are going to speak English today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to tell you a story that took place a number of years ago. One day I saw the Venerable Ananda—you know who he is? Ananda is a cousin of the Buddha, a very handsome man with a very good memory. He memorized everything the Buddha said, and after the Buddha passed away, he repeated exactly what the Buddha said during his life. Then other monks tried to learn and memorize also. Later on, all this was put down into writing and that is why we have the Sutras today. “Sutras” means the teaching of the Buddha in written form. They exist in Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese, Tibetan, and in Vietnamese, but originally it was in a kind of Bengali, very close to Pali and Sanskrit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day I saw the Venerable Ananda practicing walking meditation in front of the hut of the Buddha. You know, Ananda became a monk, a student of the Buddha. He was the attendant of the Buddha during many years. He took very good care of the Buddha. Of course, the Buddha loved him and there were people who were jealous of him. Sometimes Ananda was so concerned about the happiness of the Buddha that he forgot about himself. Sometimes he did not enjoy what was there in the present moment, being much younger than the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day standing on the hill looking down, the Buddha saw beautiful rice fields. The rice was ripe, about to be harvested. But because Ananda was only thinking of how to make the Buddha comfortable, he didn&amp;#39;t see it. So the Buddha pointed to the rice fields below and said, “Ananda can you see it&amp;#39;s beautiful?” It was like a bell of mindfulness—suddenly Ananda saw that the rice fields down there were so beautiful. The Buddha smiled and said, “Ananda, I want the robes of the monks and the nuns to be designed in the form of rice fields—golden colors like the rice that is already ripe, small portions of the rice fields like that.” Ananda said, “Yes, that is possible, I will go tell my brothers and from now on we will make the sanghati, the robes of the monks and nuns, in the form of rice fields.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another time when Ananda was with the Buddha, north of the Gangha River in the city of Vaisali, the Buddha pointed to the city, the trees, and the hills, and said to Ananda “Don&amp;#39;t you see Vaisali is beautiful?” Then Ananda took the time to look at the beauty of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day I saw Ananda practicing walking meditation around the hut of the Buddha, he was trying to protect the Buddha from guests. Many guests came, and they always wanted to have a cup of tea with the Buddha, and the Buddha could not just receive guests all day. So Ananda was trying to help. That day Ananda was practicing walking around the hut of the Buddha. It&amp;#39;s not exactly a hut, but a cave—the Buddha was staying in a cave, very cold. And Ananda saw someone coming, coming, coming in his direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had the impression that he knew this person, but just forgot his name. When that person had come very close, he recognized him as Mara. You know Mara? Mara is the one who had caused the Buddha a lot of difficulties. The night before the Buddha attained final enlightenment, Mara was there to tempt him. Buddha was tempted by Mara. Mara is the tempter. He always wanted the Buddha to be a politician, to be a king, or a president, or a foreign minister, or running a business, having a lot of money, a lot of beautiful women; and he was always trying to tempt the Buddha so that Buddha would go into these directions. That is Mara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ananda saw Mara approaching. He felt uncomfortable. Why should Mara come at this time? But Mara saw him already—Ananda could not hide himself—so he had to stand there and wait for Mara and they had to say things like, “Hello, how do you do?” People say that even if they don&amp;#39;t like each other. They say, “Hello, good morning, how are you,” and so on. They don&amp;#39;t mean it. Then they come to the real thing: “What are you here for Mara?&amp;quot; “I want to visit the Buddha,” Mara said, “I want to see him.” Ananda said, “Why should you want to see the Buddha? I don&amp;#39;t think the Buddha has time for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know when the head of a corporation or a director of an office doesn’t want to see you she says, “Go and tell him I am in conference.” And Ananda was about to say something like that, but he remembered that he had to practice the Five Precepts and could not tell a lie. So he refrained from saying that the Buddha is in conference. He was frank. He said, “Mara, why should the Buddha see you? What is the purpose and are you not ashamed of yourself? Don&amp;#39;t you remember that in the old days, under the Bodhi tree, you were defeated by the Lord? How could you bear seeing him again? I don&amp;#39;t think that he will see you. You are the enemy of the Buddha,” and Ananda continued to say what was really in his heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know Mara was very aware, a very experienced person. He just stood there and looked at the young Venerable Ananda and smiled. After Ananda finished, he said, “What did you say Ananda, you said the Buddha has an enemy?” Then Ananda felt very uncomfortable to say that the Buddha had an enemy. That did not seem to be the right thing to say, but he just said it. He said, “I don&amp;#39;t think that the Buddha will see you, you are his enemy,” So if you are not very concentrated, very deep, very mindful, you may say things like that against yourself, against what you know and what you practice. When Mara heard Ananda say that he is the enemy of the Buddha, he burst out laughing and laughing and laughing, and that made Ananda very uncomfortable. “What, you’re telling me that the Buddha also has enemies?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So finally Ananda was defeated, completely defeated. He had to go in and announce the visit of Mara, hoping that the Lord would say, “I have no time for him, I need to continue sitting.” But to his surprise, the Buddha smiled beautifully and said, “Mara, wonderful! Ask him to come in.” That surprised Ananda. Remember Ananda was young with not a lot of experience. All of us are Ananda, you know. So Ananda had to go out again and bow to Mara and ask him to come in because the Lord wanted Mara to be his guest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddha stood up, and guess what? The Buddha did hugging meditation with Mara. Ananda did not understand. The Buddha invited Mara to sit on the best place in the cave—a stone bench. And he turned to his beloved disciple and said, “Ananda, please make tea for us.” You might guess that Ananda was not entirely happy. Making tea for the Buddha—yes. He could do that 1,000 times a day. But making tea for Mara was not a very pleasant idea. But since the Lord had asked, Ananda went into a corner and began to make tea for them and tried to look deeply, why things were like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the tea was offered to the Buddha and the guest, Ananda stood behind the Buddha and tried to be mindful of what the Buddha would need. You see, if you become a novice, you have to practice being an attendant to your teacher. You stand behind him or her and you try to know what your teacher needs each moment. But it did not seem that the Buddha needed anything. He just looked at Mara in a very loving way and he said, “Dear friend, how have you been? Is everything okay?&amp;quot; Mara said “No, not okay at all. Things go very badly with me. You know something Buddha, I&amp;#39;m very tired of being Mara. Now I want to be someone else, like you. You are kind, wherever you go you are welcome. You are bowed to with lotus flowers, and you have many monks and nuns with very lovely faces following you. You are offered bananas and oranges and kiwis and all kinds of fruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a Mara I have to wear the appearance of a Mara. Everywhere I go I have to speak in a very tricky language. I have to show that I am really Mara. I have to use many tricks, I have to use the language of Mara, I have to have an army of wicked little Maras and if I breathe in and breathe out, every time I breathe out I have to show that smoke is coming from my nose. But I don&amp;#39;t mind very much all these things. What I mind most is that my disciples, the little Maras, are beginning to talk about transformation and healing. They’re beginning to talk about liberation, Buddhahood. That&amp;#39;s one thing I cannot bear. So I have come to propose to you that we exchange roles. You be a Mara and I&amp;#39;ll be a Buddha.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Venerable Ananda heard that, he was very scared. Oh, his heart was about to stop! What if his teacher accepted the exchange of roles? He would be the attendant of a Mara. So he was hoping that the Buddha would refuse the proposal. Then the Buddha looked at Mara very calmly, smiling to him, and asked this question: “Mara, do you think it&amp;#39;s a lot of fun being a Buddha? People don&amp;#39;t understand me—they misunderstand me and put a lot into my mouth that I have never said. They have built temples where they put statues of me in copper, in plaster, sometimes in emerald, in gold. And they attract a lot of people who offer them bananas, oranges, citrus, and a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes they carried me on the street in a procession and I was sitting on a cart decorated with flowers, doing like this—like a drunk person. I don&amp;#39;t like being a Buddha like that. So you know, in the name of the Buddha—in my name—they have done a lot of things that are very harmful to the Dharma. You should know that being a Buddha is also very difficult. If you want to be a teacher and if you want people to practice the Dharma correctly, that is not an easy job. I don&amp;#39;t think that you would enjoy being the Buddha. The best thing is for each of us to stay in his or her own position and try to improve the situation and enjoy what we are doing.”Then the Buddha, in order to summarize all that he just said, read to Mara a verse, a gatha. But the gatha is a little bit too long, I don&amp;#39;t remember. The essence of the gatha is just what I have said in the former part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were there with Ananda and if you were very mindful, you would have had the feeling that Buddha and Mara were a couple of friends who need each other—like day and night, like flowers and garbage. This is a very deep teaching of Buddhism, and I trust that the children will understand—very deep. You may compare Buddha with the flowers, very fresh, very beautiful. And you may compare Mara with the garbage. It doesn&amp;#39;t smell good. There are a lot of flies who like to come to the garbage. It&amp;#39;s not pleasant to touch, to hold in your hand, to smell the garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet all flowers become garbage. That is the meaning of impermanence: all flowers have to become garbage. If you practice Buddhist meditation, you find out about very interesting things—like about the garbage. Although garbage stinks, although garbage is not pleasant to hold in your hand, if you know how to take care of the garbage, you will transform it back into flowers. You know gardeners don&amp;#39;t throw away garbage. They preserve the garbage and take care of the garbage, and in just a few months the garbage becomes compost. They can use that compost to grow lettuce, tomatoes, and flowers. We have to say that organic gardeners are capable of seeing flowers in garbage, seeing cucumbers in garbage. That is what the Buddha described as the non-dualistic way of looking at things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see things like that, you will understand that the garbage is capable of becoming a flower, and the flower can become garbage. Thanks to the flowers there is garbage, because if you keep flowers for three weeks they become garbage, and thanks to the garbage there will be flowers. You now have an idea of the relationship between Buddha and Mara. Mara is not very pleasant, but if you know how to help Mara, to transform Mara, Mara will become Buddha. If you don&amp;#39;t know how to take care of the Buddha, Buddha will become Mara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see there are people who, in the beginning, love each other very much. They believe that without each other they cannot survive. Their love is so important. They cling to each other because they think that love between them is the only element that can help them survive. But because they don&amp;#39;t know how to preserve the love and take care of their love, they get angry at each other, they misunderstand each other, and later on love is transformed slowly into hate. There are those who say, “I hate you, I don&amp;#39;t want to see you anymore, I wish you would die.” Those people in the past had proclaimed that they needed each other, they could not survive without each other, they loved each other, so love transforms into hatred. It&amp;#39;s like a kind of flower transformed into garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what you learn today is very deep. Flowers and garbage are of an organic nature because both flowers and garbage are living realities. Buddha and Mara are also organic, and they need each other. It is thanks to the difficulties, thanks to the temptations, that the Buddha has overcome his suffering and his ignorance and become a fully enlightened being. The day before yesterday, I gave a Dharma talk on suffering, and I said that if you look deeply into the nature of your suffering, you will find a way out of it. So if you want a flower, you have to use the garbage. That is why the people who suffer a lot now should not be discouraged. Suffering is their garbage. If they know how to take good care of their garbage they will be able to make the flower come back to them, the flower of peace, of joy. The Buddha shows us the way to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in Moscow several years ago, we offered a retreat to Muscovites, and a few Christians from Korea held a kind of a retreat very close to ours. Some of them came to our friends and asked why they should follow the Buddha. The reason we should not follow the Buddha, according to them, is that Buddha is a mortal. “Mortal” means someone who has to die. In their mind what we need is someone who will not die. Since the Buddha is someone who has to be born and who has to die, he cannot help us—that is the meaning of the declaration made by those friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s a wonderful thing to die, because if you are born and you die, it means you are a living reality, like the flower and the garbage: they are living things. We are for life. Anything that is not born, not dying, not growing, is not alive. To be alive means to be born, to grow, to get old, to die, to be born again, to grow, to get old, to die and to continue like that. How do you expect life to be possible without change? But there is one thing that the children may like to know. There is a difference between “flower” and “flowerness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flower may die, but not the flowerness. Even if a flower has become garbage, you know you can bring the flower back. If you are a good gardener, if you know how to use compost, seeds, water, you will be able to bring the flower back. This means a flower may die, but flowerness is something that is there all the time: because flowerness is not a thing, flowerness is the nature of a thing. So it is with Buddha and Buddha nature. Buddha nature is called in Sanskrit buddhata. We all have buddhata inside of us, this Buddha nature. If we want, we can make the Buddha be born every moment in our hearts. That is a very wonderful thing. You can make the Buddha be born in your heart every moment, because you have Buddhahood in you, you have the nature of the Buddha in you. Buddha is a living thing: Buddha is born, Buddha grows up, Buddha hides himself away, Buddha dies. But Buddhahood is there in us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might think that terms like “Buddha nature” are difficult because we don’t know that this is something very simple, very simple. Children can understand very well. We have flowerness in us; we have “garbageness” in us also. Don’t think that they are two enemies—no. They look like enemies—Ananda was not very skillful in seeing that—but they can support each other. In Buddhism, there is no fight between good and evil—that is the most wonderful thing in the Buddhist practice! There is no fight between good and evil. Good and evil are both organic matters. If you have understanding and wisdom, you will know how to handle both the flower and the garbage in you, you can make the Buddha be born every moment of your life, and peace and happiness will be possible. This is a very deep Dharma talk for young people. I hope that you will be able to deepen your understanding of this Dharma talk. Your big brothers and sisters and the Dharma teachers will help you. This may be a very important lesson that you will learn in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[To the children:] When you hear the bell, please stand up and bow to the Sangha before you go out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bell. Children leave]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of this year’s summer opening, we reflected on the fact that, for healing to take place in our body and in our soul, we have to learn how to allow our body and our consciousness to rest. That is the practice of stopping, of calming in order for healing to start. We talked about the animals in the jungle. When they are wounded or get sick, they always look for a quiet and safe place to lie down. They just lie down for many, many days. The animals do not think of hunting or eating or doing anything, because they feel they need to rest and they know that only resting can bring healing. They don’t think of eating at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We humans we might think that if we don’t eat anything, we grow weak and we cannot heal. We are not as wise as these animals, because fasting is a very wonderful way to help the body and also the soul to heal. Not thinking of doing anything—eating, running, making projects for the future, even for healing, practicing intensive meditation—all these things have to be stopped. No effort should be made either by the body or by the consciousness. We have to allow our body to really rest and also our consciousness. That is samatha, that is the practice of stopping and calming, and we have to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many of us who have no capacity for resting, of allowing our body and our mind to rest. That is because in us there is a very strong tendency to do something—running. We have run without stopping in the last four or five thousand years. It has become a habit. We even run in our dreams, during our sleep. So we have to start the practice of stopping. That is why practicing being in the present moment, touching the wonders of life that are present in this moment, is a very wonderful and easy way of resting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a tendency for us to think that our happiness should be searched for in the future, by doing something. Even our health should be “searched for” by doing something. But we don’t know that not doing anything may be the key to restoring our health. Many of us are obsessed by the idea that we have to get more nutrients. We buy vitamins, “one-a-day,” and we take one pill every morning and things like that. Many of us are motivated by that kind of desire. Not many of us are aware that we have a reserve in our body that we can use for up to three or four weeks without eating. Those of us who practice fasting and drinking only water, can go for many weeks and we don’t have to stop the daily things. We can still go to sitting meditation, walking meditation, cleaning in the kitchen, in the bathroom, participating in Dharma talks. We can do that many weeks without eating. In the process, we enjoy doing these things. And the toxins we have, from the third day on, begin to get out because we are drinking a lot of water, we are practicing a lot of walking meditation and deep breathing and we clean our bodies, so the toxins can get out. And after three weeks, you look much better—even if you don’t eat anything. Your skin, the expression on your face, your smile—you may look like a new person. That is not because you take a lot of vitamins, or eat a lot of nutrients, it is because you don’t eat anything. You allow your body to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing is true of your consciousness. There are a lot of toxins within that have been accumulating over the years. We have ingested the toxins—the fear, the craving, the anger, the despair—in our daily life by touching this or that without mindfulness. So all these poisons have brought into being our depression, our anxiety, our sorrow—and this kind of garbage should be transformed, eliminated. If only we could allow ourselves to touch the refreshing and healing elements in our daily life, a process of detoxification would take place. Are you able to breathe in and to breathe out, and enjoy it? Just breathing in and breathing out. Is there anything interesting in breathing in and breathing out? Breathing in and breathing out is a wonderful thing. You are alive. The fact that you are breathing in is already a miracle. There are many people who want to breathe in but they cannot breathe in because they are already dead. We want them to breathe in but they lie there, lifeless. So to allow your body to breathe in and to become aware that you are breathing in, that you are alive, can be a source of deep happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I practiced like that in sitting meditation. When you breathe in, you might touch nature around you; when you breathe out, you allow yourself not to do anything, you rest completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bell]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice of samatha, stopping, is the practice of doing nothing—trying not to do anything, just allowing your body and your mind to rest. We know that it’s not easy, because we have already a habit of running and working, both in our body and in our mind. That is why putting yourself in a Sangha where there are people who are able to stop is very important. When you come to a retreat, where there are people who have the capacity of stopping, of being there in the present moment, you can profit from their presence, their energy. They are able to be happy with the blue sky, with a little flower blooming in the grass, with each step they make. Happiness is being manufactured every moment. They don’t run; they are able to stop and to live deeply every moment of their daily life. It’s very important that we find ourselves among those people, because touching them, we will be able to do the same after some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are on your cushion or walking, you just practice breathing in or breathing out in order to be there, just to be there. Because your mindful presence is the agent of love and care for the pain, for the suffering in you. You have not been there for yourself. You have been running and you have neglected yourself. To be loved means to be embraced by the attention, by the energy, of the person you love. When the animal stops and lies down, it’s doing that for itself. It allows itself time to rest and to heal—it is there for itself. We have to be there for ourselves. We are wounded, perhaps even deeply wounded in our body and in our soul. Who will be there for us? We have to be there for ourselves first. And the Buddha will be there for us, because the Buddha is inside of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to establish oneself in the present moment, to know what is going on in that moment, to touch everything that is happening in that moment, is the practice. It does not require a lot of struggle; it does not require any struggle at all. Just allow yourself to be. There is a tendency to think that happiness, health, success are things you have to run to in order to get. That is why we have sacrificed the present moment. We have viewed the present moment as a means to get things in the future. That is a tendency to be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to a certain idea of happiness. We think that if we cannot realize this or that, if we cannot change this or that, then happiness will never be possible. Because of our commitment to that idea of happiness, we are not at peace with ourselves. We are trying to do something, to realize something, but maybe happiness is already there. All the conditions for you to be happy are already there. You need to recognize them. How can you recognize them if you are not there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you have not realized that the sun in the sky is a condition for your happiness. Just take one second to look, and you see that all life on Earth is possible because of the sun. All our food comes from light, from the sun. And when you look at the sun like that, you see the sun as your father, your mother—it is nourishing you every day. The sun is always there for you. And you might complain that “nobody is taking care of me, nobody loves me, nobody pays attention to me,” but the sun is one thing that is nourishing you every second of your daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earth, the trees, the water, the air, the baker, the farmer, the birds, the insects. There are those of us who have practiced stopping and dwell in the present moment, and we are able to touch the many conditions of our happiness that are available in the here and the now. We find out that we don’t need more, because these conditions are more than enough to be happy. Stopping is very important. As long as you continue to run, happiness is very difficult. Stopping. Stopping allows your body and your mind to rest. Stopping allows you to recognize the conditions for your happiness that are already there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two elements of Buddhist meditation are stopping and looking deeply. You can only look deeply into the nature of things when they are there, when you are able to stop. Samatha is stopping, calming, and vipasyana is looking deeply. Sometimes you only need to stop, and suddenly a deep vision of reality will come like that. When the waves on the lake are calm, the surface of the lake is calm without waves, the full moon just reflects in the lake—the lake doesn’t have to run and look for the moon. Allow yourself to be in the present moment; enjoy touching the refreshing and healing elements that are around you and within you. Whether we believe they are or are not there, they are there. Allowing yourself to touch these healing elements will allow the garbage to become compost, and the flowers to reappear in the garden of your heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are there for yourself, there is an energy that embraces you, embraces your pain, embraces your suffering, your fear, your despair. It also embraces the good, positive qualities within you. The capacity of being joyful again, of being happy again, of being loving and tolerant—these qualities are within us, and they need to be embraced in order to grow; these are flowers. And the fear, despair, and sorrow in us need to be embraced in order to become compost. They will nourish the flowers. The Buddha needs Mara in order to grow beautifully as a flower and also Mara needs the Buddha, because Mara has a certain role to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So suffering is very important for your happiness. You cannot understand, you cannot love, until you know what suffering is. The joy of having something to eat is possible only if you know what hunger is. In some areas of China, when people meet each other, instead of asking, “How do you do?” or “How are you?” they ask, “Have you eaten yet? Have you gotten something to eat?” Because we know there is hunger, death. So our love is expressed in a very simple way: Have you eaten yet? Have you gotten anything to eat yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tendency is to want to remove and to clear away the blocks of pain and sorrow and despair in us. We just want the Buddha or God to be like a surgeon who can cut out anything we don&amp;#39;t want of ourselves, get it out of our system. In the light of non-duality, not only are we flowers, but we are also the garbage in us. We cannot just get rid of us. Sometimes we are love, sometimes we are anger; love is us, but anger is also us. So we have to treat both love and anger on an equal basis, like the Buddha was treating Mara. Mara didn&amp;#39;t understand. Ananda also didn&amp;#39;t understand. But the Buddha, he understood. He was teaching both of them the nature of non-duality between suffering and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The energy of mindfulness is the energy that allows us to be in the present moment, to embrace ourselves, our suffering, our despair, our sorrow; and also the seeds of joy and peace and love that have become weak in us because we have not been able to water and cultivate these seeds to help them to be stronger. So the practice is the practice of embracing, and it is clear that the energy with which you can embrace yourself is the energy of mindfulness. “Darling, I am there for you.” When we love someone we want to make such a declaration, “Darling I am there for you.” And you have to be really there for her. Your presence is the greatest gift you can make to the person you love. To be there, it&amp;#39;s not easy. You have to be there with one hundred per cent of yourself. You have to be really mindful, with all your attention. That energy has the power of healing and of making the other person happy. In this case it is self-love, and we all know that the love we have for another depends on our self-love. If we know how to take care of ourselves, if we know how to nourish and to transform ourselves, we will be able to take care of the other person. So the object of love is our self first—our body and our consciousness. Embracing yourself in the present moment is the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By being there entirely, you recognize that not only suffering is there, something else is there—the wonders of life, the refreshing and healing elements from within and around and you may like to practice touching them. Look at the sky; listen to the rain, smile to it. It&amp;#39;s wonderful that it&amp;#39;s raining, it&amp;#39;s wonderful that the sky is blue this morning, it&amp;#39;s wonderful that I am here, alive. It&amp;#39;s wonderful that I can walk, it&amp;#39;s wonderful that my heart still functions normally. There are so many things you can enjoy. When one tree in the garden dies you may forget that all the other trees are still alive. You let your sorrow dominate, and suddenly you lose everything. When a tree is dying in my garden, yes, I know it, but there are other trees that are still green, healthy. If you remember that, you will not be drowned by your sorrow, and you will have enough strength to save the tree that is dying or replace it with another tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make your heart large so that you may be able to see that the conditions for your happiness are there, and injustice, cruelty, or meanness is not enough to ruin your life. You can accept it easily, because your heart is large, and you can receive it without resentment and anger. It&amp;#39;s like when you throw some dirt into the river, the river would not be angry. The river is willing to accept that dirt, and it can transform that dirt overnight. There&amp;#39;s so much water in the river, so much mud in the water that the amount of dirt that you throw into the river will be transformed overnight. If you throw that dirt into a container of water in your home that would not be the same thing. You know that the water in the container will no longer be drinkable, you have to throw it away. But when you throw that amount of dirt into the river, people from the city still continue to drink the water from the river because it’s large. The river has the capacity of transforming and healing. So practice being like a river, that is what the Buddha recommended to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice being like the earth. Whether people throw on earth flowers, perfumes, rice, curries or they throw on it urine, excrement, the earth will be willing to accept all without any resentment, because earth is large and earth has the power to transform. And earth is always there for us. So the Buddha told Rahula, “My dear, practice like earth, practice like water in the river and you will not suffer because your heart is big.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So coming back to embrace ourselves, to start the process of healing, to touch the positive elements does not seem to be a difficult practice. You only need a Sangha where there are people who are doing that and who enjoy just doing that. When you come to the Meditation Hall and sit down holding your plate of food, you may do it with a lot of pleasure. Don&amp;#39;t think of it as a hard practice. Yes, we don’t talk during the whole meal, you sit quiet in an erect position during the whole meal. Yes, we do that. But many of us enjoy doing that. We don&amp;#39;t have to talk, we don&amp;#39;t have to think, we don&amp;#39;t have to do anything: we just realize complete rest during the whole meal. To be able to share a meal with a Sangha in mindfulness, not to have to do anything at all, to just enjoy every morsel of your food, touching your food deeply without any thinking, without making any project in your mind is the practice, the practice of stopping and resting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think that it&amp;#39;s oppressive not to talk. It&amp;#39;s difficult to stay in a sitting position like this for one hour, but that is because you are so used to running and to doing movements. But to allow yourself to sit for one hour, not (indiscernible words) enjoy our upright position, enjoy our in-breath and our out-breath, not to think of anything, just enjoy. Because being there sitting, not doing anything is a very nice thing to do, and just to be aware of our in-breath and our out-breath, and just to relax the muscles on our face, our body, is a nice thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you pick up a piece of string bean, look at it, smile, and call it by its true name, “string bean.” And you realize with some mindfulness and concentration that the piece of string bean is a wonder of life, exactly like you—you are a wonder of life, you are a miracle. The piece of string bean has been made by clouds, sunshine, the earth, the minerals, the air, the water, everything. This piece of string bean is really an ambassador coming to you from the cosmos if you know how to receive it, how to be with it, how to chew it mindfully and joyfully. Eating a piece of string bean may give joy. What is the use of eating a piece of string bean? To get nutrition? No, you just enjoy the piece of string bean, you enjoy yourself, the presence of the bean, you enjoy the moment, being with yourself and with the Sangha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like to chew our food thirty times, forty times, fifty times. During that time we don&amp;#39;t chew anything else, we don&amp;#39;t chew our projects, our sorrow, our anxiety. Allow it to sleep, you are embracing it now by the practice of being there, mindful. Eating is a practice, a practice of not doing anything, a practice of stopping. And with some intelligence, we can make the time of eating a time of joy. It may be oppressive not talking, not laughing, not making movements. But they are only the habits; you have to learn the habit of resting, it&amp;#39;s very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting on your cushion during sitting meditation is also practicing resting, and practicing walking meditation, just touching the earth and realizing the wonder of being alive and walking on the earth, this is also the practice of resting. In every moment you allow yourself to be there and to take care of your sorrow, your anxiety, your pain. They may be sleeping quietly down there in the bottom of your consciousness, or they may be emerging on the surface. In any case, embrace them; embrace them with your true presence, because the energy of mindfulness is the energy of being there for you, for the people you love. The sun is there for you, the moon is there for you, the trees are there for you, the water is there for you, and you should be there for them also, especially for yourself. You are the person who needs you the most. Call your name, call your name in silence—that person has suffered, that person needs you desperately, you should go back and embrace her, embrace him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bell]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let us do a meditation exercise. Let us visualize ourselves as young people who are caught in a situation of drugs. There are so many young people who are addicted to drugs in Europe, in America, everywhere. This is a big problem of the twentieth century, and we don&amp;#39;t know whether we will be able to solve it during the first half of the twenty-first century. This is some garbage that needs to be taken care of. Who are these young people who every day seek desperately to have some money to buy some drugs? Even if you know how to get some drugs, you don&amp;#39;t know how to get the money. You may have tried to steal the money from your parents, which is safer than stealing from other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many of us who suffer in Europe, in Asia, in America. We are suffering, we are despair, we are sorrow, we need to be embraced. We are the garbage of humanity. We want to go back to being flowers. Who will help us? What kind of presence could be given to us? We suffer; we don&amp;#39;t need suppression, we don&amp;#39;t need the army, we don&amp;#39;t need the police. We really need a kind of presence that helps us to transform, because we don&amp;#39;t want to be in this position. But we are in this position, a position where we have to seek every day a means to get some drugs. Where is humanity? Who can help us? Who can manifest their true presence in order to embrace us? Who knows that we are suffering? They think that we only need punishment. They don&amp;#39;t know how difficult it is for us to get out of our situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The energy that we need is enlightenment, is mindfulness. We need people to know that we suffer, that we don&amp;#39;t want to be like this for a long time, because maybe tomorrow it will be too difficult for us to continue and we may have to kill ourselves. So we need desperately some kind of presence that tells us they know that we are there, we suffer and they are there for us.Who are they? People in the church, they don&amp;#39;t really want to do something to help us. Our parents, what have they done for us to be like we are today? It&amp;#39;s not because we just want to be addicted to drugs, it&amp;#39;s because we have suffered so much. We feel wounded, we feel no way out, that we have to look for some drugs to be able to forget our situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people in the Church don&amp;#39;t seem to understand us. There may be nice people in the Church, they may want to do something, but in a majority of the cases they are preaching to us a kind of teaching that cannot respond to our real need. They are trying to impose on us the kind of life that does not seem to fit us. Understanding and compassion does not seem to come from the direction of the Church.We have practiced and our teacher says that we have to go back to our spiritual roots. We have tried. We had to start, we have started to going back to Mass but still, they are still narrow-minded. They don&amp;#39;t know what our suffering is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our parents, they don&amp;#39;t seem to be happy with each other. They make each other suffer. They created hell in our family. We have not been able to see happiness in the family. We have not experienced harmony, compassion and love in our family life. They don&amp;#39;t seem to understand us. They don&amp;#39;t seem to love us. How could love be possible without understanding? We don&amp;#39;t see anything beautiful in this life. Everything is ugly. We don&amp;#39;t see anything meaningful in this life. We don&amp;#39;t see anything true in this life, everything seems to be fake. So we are hungry ghosts, looking for something meaningful and true. Since we have not found anything, we have to forget we are there and drugs seem to be the only thing for us. This is a block of garbage produced collectively during the twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditation on this scale means to produce a presence of enlightened people—governmental people, doctors, psychotherapists, educators, artists and so on. We have to come as a group, as a Sangha, to produce our true presence. “Dear people, we know that you are there, we know that you suffer, that is why we have come to you and embrace you, not with the intention to punish or to blame, but just to embrace you. We want to understand you better; we want to love you.” That is the presence they need: that is collective meditation. Maybe in coming together our insight will be deep enough to provide these people with a positive environment for their healing and their liberation—a healing center, rehabilitation center, where these young people can get the minimum dose of drugs they need every day so that they don&amp;#39;t have to go and kill or steal in order to get the drugs. Where they can be taken good care of, and get help in order to reduce the amount of drugs and start the process of healing, touching the things that surround us that are healthy, that are refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If those of us who are doctors, governmental people, artists, psychotherapists don&amp;#39;t practice for ourselves, we won&amp;#39;t have insight and compassion and understanding; how can we help take care of the garbage we have produced? Who is responsible for producing this garbage? All of us. Blaming other people will not help, especially blaming the victims. We have to realize that they are us, we are them, that our life is made of flowers and garbage at the same time. We have to accept both and to take care of both in the best way that we can, with the understanding, the calm, provided by our practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government of Holland has tried to do things, the government of France, of Spain, many governments; the government of the United States of America also has tried many ways to help. But where are we? Haven&amp;#39;t we realized that we are responsible for the production of the garbage? Our society is produced in such a way that we create hungry ghosts very young, every day, by the thousands, by the hundreds of thousands. They are everywhere, wandering around without anything to believe in, without anything to love, without anything that looks true and good and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know whether during the first half of the twenty-first century we can handle this problem of drugs, of the hungry ghosts that we produce. We have to call on people in all walks of life—parents, Church, teachers, businessmen and others—to stop and look. This is very important, stopping and looking at our present situation and considering how to start transforming garbage into flowers. We have to organize Dharma discussions on a very big scale. We have to organize it in our family, we have to organize it in our city, we have to make it into a national debate where people may have a say, where each person makes a contribution of his or her insight. That is a matter for all of us, that is meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As individuals we have problems; but we also have problems as families, as cities, as nations, and meditation in the twenty-first century should be a collective practice. Without a Sangha we cannot achieve much. When we focus our attention on suffering, on the garbage on a larger scale, maybe the little problems that we have within our individual circle will vanish, because by practicing being there we begin to connect with, to relate to, other people who are also ourselves. That way our loneliness, our feeling of being cut off, will no longer be there, and we will be able to do things together. Like when we come to Plum Village, we try to be part of the Sangha, we practice as a Sangha. It&amp;#39;s much easier, and transformation will take place much more quickly if you don&amp;#39;t just practice as individuals. When I practice walking I make mindful and beautiful steps. I know that I do that not only for myself, but also for all of my friends who are here; because everyone, who sees me taking a step like that has confidence and is reminded to do the same. And when they make a step in the present moment, smiling and making peace with themselves, they inspire us all, they are doing that for all of us. You breathe for me, I walk for you, we do things together and this is practicing as a Sangha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today please enjoy your walking if it doesn&amp;#39;t rain. If it rains, you enjoy the rain. We also have a formal meal together. A formal meal is a time when we sit together as a Sangha, we enjoy the collective energy of mindfulness, and each of us allows the mindful energy of the Sangha to penetrate in. Even if you don&amp;#39;t do anything, just stop thinking and allow yourself to absorb the collective energy of the Sangha. It&amp;#39;s very healing. Don&amp;#39;t struggle, don&amp;#39;t try to do something. Allow yourself to rest, and the energy of the Sangha will help. Eat your meal very slowly, mindfully; enjoy every morsel of food. That is the most important thing to do during eating, just enjoy every morsel of food, chew it carefully and slowly. That allows the pain, the sorrow in us to be embraced.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;The Five-Fold Steps of Training&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dharma Dharma Talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh on August 4th, 1996 in Plum Village, France.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;© Thich Nhat Hanh
August 4, 1996&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good morning, my friends. Today is the fourth of August, 1996, we are in the Lower Hamlet, and we are going to speak English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past three weeks we have been talking with each other about how to run the twenty-first century, how to climb together the hill of the twenty-first century, with joy and peace and happiness. We already talked about a room in our home so that we can practice restoring our self, restoring peace, joy and communication. We also talked about a little park in our neighborhood so that people in the neighborhood may enjoy walking meditation, sitting together in peace, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have talked about how to maintain peace in school. I think we have to ask schoolteachers how we could have more peace and joy and harmony in school. Not only do we have to ask them, but we have to sit down together, teachers and students, in order to decide how we can make the school a beautiful place in which to live. I know of a number of schools where teachers and students practice being quiet during the first three or five minutes and just enjoy breathing in and out; and every time there is disharmony, there is anger, in school, everyone in the school practices sitting down and breathes in and out peacefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think that this is a Buddhist practice alone; it is a practice that everyone likes. I am sure that the Catholics like the practice, the Protestants, the Jews, the Muslims also, because everyone values peace and harmony, and everyone knows that to breathe in and out deeply is very good. Doctors, scientists, nurses: they know very well that breathing quietly, slowly and deeply is very good. When a nurse gives you a shot, she may ask you to breathe in and out peacefully, and while you are preoccupied with breathing in and out, she just gives the shot and you don’t feel anything at all; you feel fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know of a school teacher whose name is Henry. He teaches mathematics in a high school in Toronto. He is old—I think he has arrived at the age where he can retire; but the principal of the high school and all the other teachers asked him to stay on because people like his teaching so much. The first time he came to Plum Village for the practice of mindfulness, he confessed that the thing he liked best was to go fishing. When other people could not catch a fish, he did not know why, but he continued to catch fish after fish. That is why he liked it so much. But after staying in Plum Village, he decided that killing fish like that is not a nice thing. These beautiful little animals are swimming very happily in the stream, and suddenly you’ve caught them, and they die. So he decided to abandon fishing as a hobby, and he thought that, when he went home, he would find other kinds of joys. He found a lot of joys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he had some difficulties adjusting the way of life he learned at Plum Village to his environment. The day class resumed, he came in the classroom using walking meditation. He never did that before. He opened the door slowly, he entered slowly, he smiled to the students, and he walked slowly to his desk. And then when he stood up and wiped the blackboard, he did it mindfully, slowly, and all the students were very surprised. They thought that he was sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they asked, “Papa, are you sick?” Because they love him; he’s a very excellent mathematics teacher. He was very well known in Vietnam as a mathematics teacher. He wrote many good books on mathematics. He used to get angry with his students. Every time a child couldn’t give an answer to his question or showed his stupidity, he would get angry. He might just pick up a piece of chalk and throw it directly to the head of the student. That’s the way he had done in the past. And when he corrected math exercises, he might get angry; he might write down, “You are stupid.” But still, the students liked him. There is something in him that makes the students like him, that is why they call him “Papa.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Papa, are you sick?” He smiled and said, “No, I am not sick. I am practicing mindfulness.” “What is mindfulness?” He began to explain, “I am wiping out the things on the blackboard, and I do it slowly, I dwell in the present moment, and I enjoy doing that. I don’t hurry in order to finish it. I just enjoy every step I make. You see, this morning, I came in, I saw you, I’m very happy. So I just stop and look at you and smile, and that makes me very happy.” He spent a few minutes talking about what he had learned in Plum Village. Then he talked with them about the wonders of mindful breathing. He said, “I got a lot of calm when I was in Plum Village, and I want you to try it. Let us sit down; we don’t have any bell here, but I will ask a boy to do like this [clap, clap] and then all of us just sit quietly and enjoy breathing in, calming, and breathing out, smiling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There they went, the boy in the front did like this [clap, clap] and then he and all the rest of the students practiced breathing in and breathing out. He said, “That is excellent. Why don’t we do it for two minutes?” And they did it for two minutes. I think the students listen to him and like to try because they have sympathy with him. He proposed that every fifteen minutes there would be a pause of two minutes. Another boy would take a turn to [clap, clap] and then everyone would stop. He would stop lecturing, and everyone would practice breathing and smiling. They don’t have a bell, so they just stopped by the sound. After a few months of practice like that, both teachers and students realized that they had made a lot of progress in their studies. The class has grown much more peaceful. And they love it, they continue that practice of breathing, smiling, in the beginning of the class and in the middle of the class. So, they could have three times to breathe in and out and enjoy being together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Henry reported to me in a letter that other classes learned about that, and they adopted the same kind of breathing in, out, and get three breaks during the hour of mathematics. At one point the whole school knew about the practice, and all of them enjoyed it. And that is why, when our Professor Henry asked for retirement, they said, &amp;quot;No, you have to stay on, you have helped us so much.&amp;quot; Now Professor Henry no longer does things like throwing a piece of chalk directly at the head of his students. He told me that one time when he was correcting an exercise, he saw that the student did not understand anything at all. In the past he would write down, “You are stupid,” but this time he did not write down that kind of word. He wrote like this: “My dear, you d= on’t understand; that’s my fault.” A very deep transformation. And the student who received that correction got moved to tears. “It’s my fault because I did not try my best to help you understand, that is why you don’t understand me.” Henry has come back to Plum Village several times for the practice; he’s coming for this September retreat. He received the Five Wonderful Precepts many years ago, and finally he was asked to become a Dharma teacher. Those of you who will be back here for September, you will meet him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I would like to tell the young people who are here today, you can practice peace at school. The other day I asked you to ask your teacher when there is a conflict between you and someone else and you get irritated or angry, and you don’t know what to do to preserve peace and to reconcile. A teacher should know. If she does not know yet, it is her duty to go and learn from someone else. It’s very important; you just ask the question, and you make the wheel begin to turn. Yesterday, a mother told me that her daughter did not speak English, so her daughter had asked her to ask me what she can do every time she gets angry: I recommended that they ask their mother first. So if you ask your mother or your father that question, and the answer is not completely satisfying, then they will try harder and next time they will show you not only the theory, but also the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our hospitals, we’ve got to have a practice center. I have seen in many big cities, like in Amsterdam, hospitals in which there is a meditation hall, a chapel for the people to sit, to pray, to meditate. This is very important, because the people who are sick need a place to practice, and when their families come, they also need a place to practice. And when a relative undergoes surgery, members of their families, in order to deal with their worries, should be able to practice, and they need a center like that. There should be brothers and sisters who are trained in the art of meditation in order to serve in these hospitals. I think I am going to write a letter to the monks and nuns in Vietnam, and also to the government, about how to set up a meditation hall in every hospital of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think that a meditation hall is needed in each school for students and for teachers. I know teachers sometimes suffer very much because of their students and they need to practice, and students also need to practice; therefore, to have a meditation hall or a chapel in school, that is very important. We have the right to ask for that. You know that all spiritual traditions, they would tell you that you need the same kind of thing. It is neither a Buddhist, nor a Christian, nor a Jewish practice, it is just practice; because all of us need peace, restoration, and so on. So in the twenty-first century I’m confident that people, including yourself, will try your best in order to set up meditation halls in schools and in hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bell]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would ask also for a meditation hall in each city’s central park. The park is something like an island of peace. When the people in the city are suffocated, they don’t feel well within their body, in their mind, they would think of the park. If they are in the middle of the week, they cannot get out of town, then the park is the answer. That is why you have to take care of the central park. We have to make all the trees and streams of water clear and beautiful; we need silence in the park. And we need a meditation hall without any symbols, whether Buddhist or Catholic or Jewish. We don’t need symbols, because it is for everyone. In Bois de Boulogne, Bois de Vincennes, even in the Tivoli park, we need a meditation hall. Of course, in a park we would need ice cream and hot chocolate, but we must have a meditation hall. By the way, I don’t like children to eat too many ice creams in Plum Village. I think a child is entitled to have one only each day, that is the maximum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I want a meditation hall in the parliament house, in the city hall, because I have seen people debating in the house of parliament. This is war, this is not peace. They hit each other with poisonous arrows of speech. They are angry, they don’t have peace at all, and we don’t want people without peace to represent us in parliament. Do you? No. If they don’t have peace, they don’t have harmony within themselves and with the other members of the parliament, then they make decisions that go against our interests. So if you are a writer, if you are an artist, if you are a member of the parliament, if you are a member of the city council, or if you are only a householder, you have to do everything in your power to express your view that you want the person who represents you in the Congress and in the city hall to practice peace. Before you vote for him or for her, look; look carefully to see whether in his or her family, there is harmony or not. This is very important; we have to ask. We have the right to ask whether they have harmony with their partner, their children, because they are public people and they have to make everything transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should be able to know whether they can use loving speech, whether they can master their anger, whether they can practice somehow looking deeply. Because looking deeply is a matter for everyone, especially for those who have to confront very difficult problems concerning the economy, social conflicts, social injustice, and especially war with another country. If you have no right view within you, if you have no insight within you, you have no harmony, understanding, or compassion, you may declare war with another country and you draw the whole country into war. This is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, there must be a meditation hall in Congress. It would be beautiful if Congressmen or Senators, before starting a session, would sit together breathing in and out, in peace and make the determination to hold the session in peace and harmony and not just fight each other. This is very important. This is peace education, and who can realize that? You claim to be a democracy, so you have to do it. Citizens have to do it. So when we sit for Dharma discussion, we have to find ways in order to put into practice what we learn from the Five Wonderful Steps of Training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the city hall, we need it. Suppose the river that goes through our city is polluted, fish die in that river, who will be responsible? The whole city is responsible; but it is the city council that has to take the matter in hand, so they have to practice looking deeply together at how to save the river. In your home, in your neighborhood, you also organize for looking deeply at your part; and at the city center, city council, they have to practice looking deeply at their part. And we may support them with our insight: “Dear city council, we are in that quarter of the city, we have sat down, we have practiced looking deeply, and this is what we have found out.” We can support our city council by the fruit of our practice of looking deeply. The city council, the city hall, has to make decisions based on this insight. If they don’t, next time they will not be in the city council. All this is practice, and we practice as a Sangha and not as individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about places like l’Elysee or the White House, where the president and the government meet to make decisions? How about the military headquarters? I think it is like in our home: there should be a place of peace for the president, for his ministers, to sit in, to breathe together, to calm themselves, before they look into the urgent matters of the nation. And you have the right to request that. You have to speak out your aspiration, after having practiced looking deeply. We don’t ask them to follow any particular religion; we just ask them to have a little bit more peace and calm and understanding and harmony within themselves, and we are ready to support them. We will write letters without anger, we will practice talking to them with loving kindness; but we have to do nonviolent action. Loving action has to be taken by us every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decision-making is too important to leave to them alone; you have to take in hand your own fate, and therefore I want the children to hear this, because the twenty-first century is theirs. We adults are very sorry not to have been able to do it during the twentieth century, so we hope that in the twenty-first century you will be able to do that. We are already a little bit enlightened on the matter; we have suffered so much, and we have made you suffer. So we will be supporting you wholeheartedly, and many of us will be climbing with you the hill of the twenty-first century. Please, the people who are less young, also have Dharma discussions on this and make known your insight, your decisions. Now, the young people, when they hear the small bell, they would stand up and bow to the Sangha before they go out to continue their studies and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear friends, the Buddhadharma is described as something that you can come and see by yourself. You don’t have to believe something through another person, even the clergy, the priest, the mediator. The ultimate dimension of reality is something you can touch, you can see by yourself. And you can do it now, and here; it’s not a problem of time. It’s not a promise. In the method of Buddhism as I see it, it’s very concrete; there’s no place to speculate, to suppose, to create an hypothesis. When the Buddha set out to teach and to help people, the first thing he asked people is to look directly into their suffering. Suffering is not an abstract thing; suffering is there, very real. Suffering is one of the basic truths called holy truths, the Noble Truths. Suffering is a holy truth. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vietnamese we call it thanh de, the holy truth. The word that the Buddha used is dukkha; dukkha means ill-being, pain, suffering, translated by Chinese kou. This word, kou, originally in Chinese means bitter, the opposite of sweet. It makes you suffer. And you have to look at it. Why is suffering a holy truth? Because, without suffering, you have no way out. The first thing you have to do is to look, and look deeply, into the nature of your suffering. If you cannot do that, if you try to run away from it, there’s no way that you can transform your suffering. That is why suffering is the basic truth and a holy truth. It means we have to learn from our suffering. We have to understand our suffering. If we don’t know anything about our suffering, if we cannot learn anything about our suffering, suffering is no longer a holy truth. Holy or not holy: it depends on our way of handling suffering. And the Buddha said suffering is absolutely necessary for you to find a way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Zen teacher in Vietnam during the 13th century urged his students to practice diligently in order to get out of the world of birth and death. And a student asked him, “Teacher, please show us how to get out of the world of birth and death.” And he said, “You have to look for the world of no birth and no death.” Then the student asked, “But where can we find the world of no birth and no death?” And the teacher said, “You look for it right in the world of birth and death.” It means, out of suffering you will find the way of transcending the suffering. It sounds like something contradictory, but it is the basic Buddhist teaching. So looking into the nature of suffering, you can see many, many things that you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How that suffering has come to be, that is the second truth. That is about the nature of your suffering. If you already see the nature of your suffering, how it has come to be, you are already on your way to liberation. That is a sentence uttered by the Buddha. Dear friends, if you look into the nature of your suffering, and if you see already what kind of nutriment that has brought about that suffering, you are already on the path of liberation; because everything needs food to grow, to be there, including your suffering. So if you look into your suffering, and if you can see how that has come to be, what kind of food you have fed it so that it is now there as a hard fact, then you are already on the way of liberation, because you have already seen a path of liberation. So the nature of your suffering is the cause of your suffering, the nutriment, the food that you have used in order to feed your suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you suffer from a depression now, your depression is dukkha, suffering. So you look into your depression; you need your depression in order to understand your depression. You should not try to run away from it. Go back; confront your depression; embrace it and look deeply into it, and you’ll find out after a few days of practice that in the past few months or few years, you have lived in such a way that made depression possible now. Because your depression cannot come just like that, without any cause. You have got the nutrition, the nutriments, the food that has brought about the depression. What you have eaten, what you have drunk, what you have listened to, what you have viewed, what you have touched, are the kind of nutriments that have made up your depression now. So if you know the nature of your depression, you also know how to stop feeding your depression. And you use other kinds of nutriments for yourself, and a few months later, your depression will be gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose the person you love just betrayed you and goes with another person. In the beginning you had hope that he and you would live a long life together, sharing everything, and he or she has made the solemn promise to live together until your hair becomes white, until all your teeth come out. But now, he just abandoned you and followed a young woman. You feel the victim of injustice. You cannot just accept that. You cannot accept the betrayal. You want him, you want her to be faithful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your suffering is there, and we advise you to embrace your suffering and look deeply into it and look into how that kind of betrayal has come to be. Who is responsible? What kind of nutriment has made it possible? That is the Buddhist way. You are advised to do it by yourself, if possible with the help of other brothers and sisters in the Dharma. They can do it with you. They can join their mindfulness and the practice of deep looking with you, and help you to discover the nature, the cause of your suffering. If I sit with you, if I practice with you, I may find out that you have been somehow responsible for his act of betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Buddhist teaching, we learn that we have all kinds of seeds within our consciousness. This is our consciousness; it is made up of two levels, at least. The deeper level is called store consciousness. In Buddhist psychology, we speak of consciousness in terms of seeds, les semences. The Sanskrit word is bija. We learn that in the store consciousness, we have all kinds of seeds within here. Seeds of compassion, mindfulness, tolerance, endurance, peace, joy, loving kindness. We have all the good seeds in us. And the Buddha is also there as a seed, the seed of Buddhahood, the seed of enlightenment, the seed of concentration, the seed of loving kindness, the seed of mindfulness. It is a fact, and not just a dogma, that you have the Buddha nature in you. You can touch it, you can make a demonstration, you can verify it. Because, according to this practice, mindfulness is the Buddha and loving kindness is the Buddha; understanding is the Buddha; and all of us have the potential of being mindful, of being understanding, of being compassionate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children have proved that at times they can be compassionate, mindful, understanding; and adults also. That is the Buddha nature in us. When I ask you to drink your glass of water mindfully, you can do it, you can drink your water mindfully. That means mindfulness is possible for you; you have a seed of mindfulness within your store consciousness. That is why you can practice, and you can be successful in drinking your water mindfully, or in walking mindfully. That is a demonstration that Buddha is in you, because mindfulness is very often described as the energy of a Buddha. A Buddha, a real Buddha, is made with that kind of energy. You have it. You don’t need to believe, because you already have direct knowledge about it. It’s not exactly a religious belief; this is just an experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in your store consciousness there are other, negative, seeds, like the seed of ignorance, the seed of forgetfulness which is the opposite of mindfulness. Strange, you have the seed of mindfulness and you have the opposite kind of seed. Mara is the equivalent of Satan. If you want to invite the Buddha, you can. If you want to invite Satan to come up, he will be glad to come up. And Buddha and Mara both are of an organic nature. That is the teaching of the Buddha. Buddha and Mara, mindfulness and forgetfulness, both of them are organic substance because they can deteriorate. It’s like a flower and garbage. A flower can become the piece of garbage. The piece of garbage, if you know how to do it, will be transformed back into the flower. Mindfulness and forgetfulness play the role of flower and garbage in us, also Buddha and Mara, because we are a living reality; we are not a piece of inert matter in a museum of life. We are a living thing, therefore everything in us is alive, including Buddha and Mara. How wonderful: Buddha is alive in us, not a notion, a concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you have that seed of jealousy in you. You have also the seed of betrayal in you. All of us are able to betray the people we love, not only he, but you. All of us have the seed of loyalty, all of us have the seed of betrayal. If you have not betrayed him, it is because the seed of betrayal in you has not been watered by yourself and by the people who live around you. But if you allow your seed of betrayal to be watered today, tomorrow, by yourself and by the people around you, one day you will betray him, you will betray her. That’s something sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, practice looking deeply to see, what have you done in the past? Have you allowed the seed of betrayal in him to be watered? Who has watered that seed? Did you water that seed yourself? Have you made an effort to remain fresh and loving? If you have not made any effort to remain fresh and pleasant, then you yourself have contributed to the watering of the seed of betrayal. People usually love what is lovable. If you have stopped being lovable, then you help the other way. Have you been very mindful in taking care of him? Have you allowed a situation to happen in which his seed of betrayal has been able to be watered every day? Outside of your mindfulness you have allowed everything to take place, and now you blame him, blame that person for your suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the suffering, the cause of the suffering comes from yourself, mostly. You just think that you are a victim of injustice, all the suffering that you have now has come from the other person. You blame him or her entirely, and that is injustice on your part because you don’t see the truth. You don’t know how to handle your suffering, you don’t know how to look into that holy truth, suffering, in order to see the real nature of that suffering. The first truth is holy, that is suffering. The second truth is holy also, that is the nature of your suffering. You need mindfulness, you need looking deeply, you need concentration in order to find out that holy truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third truth is that your suffering can be healed, can be transformed. Because it is not a hope, it is a fact that if something has come, it can go away. If you used some kind of nutriment to bring up something, now if you don’t want that something to stay, you just cut the nutriment. That is the simple truth, the truth of the absence of suffering. Suffering can be transformed, that is the third holy truth. It’s rather comforting. There are people who say Buddhism is a little bit too pessimistic, they always begin with talking about suffering. But that is not pessimism; that is realism, realistic. Because when you peer into the truth of suffering, you see not only the second noble holy truth, but also the third noble truth, which is the possibility of removing the suffering. That’s rather good news. You are confident that with some practice, you can end the suffering, you can bring back the state of well-being to you, and to the people around you. Because the first truth is the presence of ill-being, the third truth is the absence of ill-being, which means at the same time the presence of well-being. That’s nirvana; nirvana is the extinction of suffering and of all the nutriments that have brought suffering to you. Is it too late or not? It’s never too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bell]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering is still going on if you don’t practice, or if the other person doesn’t practice. So now, if you want to take the initiative, you don’t demand anything, you don’t require any preconditions, you just begin to stop feeding your suffering. You do it with your faith in the third noble truth, holy truth. “I have to stop feeding my pain, my suffering.” And that kind of conviction, that kind of attitude can already bring you a lot of comfort. Then we learn that we have to practice expanding our heart. We should be able to realize many conditions of our happiness and peace. We should have several roots. The other day when I talked to the young people, I told them that if we are mindful, we can be aware of many things, many elements in us and around us that can make us happy. Don’t commit yourself to just one idea of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a layman who was asked to give a Dharma talk to monks and nuns because he was so well versed in Buddhism. That happened in the 1930&amp;#39;s in Hue. It was to him a very great joy to be able to help the monks and the nuns with his knowledge and understanding of the sutra. I think he was teaching the Surangama Sutra. Before coming to the chair to teach, he touched the earth three times before his students. One day, as he was walking up the hill to go to the temple to give his instructions on the Surangama, he saw two young boys on the sidewalk enjoying a chess game. He also enjoyed playing, so he wanted to take a few minutes to sit with the little boys, and he enjoyed it so much that he almost forgot that he had to go to the temple and give the Dharma talk. Another friend of his, coming by, saw him like that. He said, “Dear friend, do you know what time it is now? Let us go!” And then he climbed the hill with the other person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His name is Tam Minh, Clarity of the Heart. He had the capacity of being happy with whatever was there around him and in him. To give a Dharma talk to the monks and nuns was a joy, but to sit down with children was also a joy. And not only that; everything around him could make him happy. So we should not commit ourselves to just one thing. We should not ruin our life just because of one thing. A French poet said, “Un seul être me manque, et tout est dépeuplé,” “Only one person is not there, and I see the whole world as empty.” Why? Why behave like that? Because there are many living beings around; why look upon them as nonexistent? How could that being be there if all of us were not there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So look deeply into the nature of your suffering and practice loving kindness, practice understanding, so that you will not continue to blame. You see your responsibility, you see your way of salvation, of liberation, you are able to touch many wonders of life that are available to you in the here and the now, and suddenly you become the most attractive person, very refreshing, very healing. And everyone will go back to you, because we need you. If you are fresh, happy, peaceful like that, every one of us will need you, will look in your direction, they would follow you, especially those of us who are suffering a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first holy truth is dukkha, suffering; the second truth is the nature of our suffering, samut kaya and the cause of our suffering, the n. . . [GAP -- end of side two of latest tape]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third truth is the possibility of removing the suffering, Narodha. The absence, the taking away of suffering, which means at the same time the presence of well-being. The fourth truth is Marga, the way, the way of practice, the dharma. How not to continue to feed your suffering; how to offer yourself the opposite kind of nutriments; that is, the dharma The Five Steps of Training are really the way. The way as presented by our teacher, the Buddha, is the Eightfold Noble Path. Right understanding, right speech, right thinking, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. If you practice the Five Steps of Training, you practice the Eightfold Noble Path in a very concrete way. If you put all your being into the practice, if you abide by the practice of mindfulness of consuming, of speaking, of listening, then that is the suppression of the suffering because you don’t allow the nutriment for suffering to continue any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day, we were speaking about the First, the Second, and the Third Steps of Training: to protect life, to practice giving, social justice, and to preserve the integrity of couples and families and protect children from sexual abuse. All these things are right action, right view, right efforts. The moment when you undertake to practice these precepts, trainings, you already begin to get relief. I will offer you an example. There was a Vietnam war veteran who came and participated in a retreat offered by us to about thirty or forty former soldiers, army officers, who had fought in Vietnam, together with twenty or thirty other people, including psychotherapists and family members and so on. I remember we had to practice listening deeply every day and with a lot of patience in order to allow a situation where the veterans can speak out. It’s very difficult, because many of them were caught in their own suffering, it’s very hard for them to touch their suffering, and to talk about it. Sometimes I had to sit there for half an hour not saying anything, just breathing and smiling, and show our compassion, our readiness to listen. Yet no one could speak a word. And we begin again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a war veteran who tried to join us in walking meditation, but he was so fearful. During the war he had learned that you can get into an ambush very easily, and there were many Vietnamese there. A Buddhist monk can be a guerrilla in disguise. So he was scared to death. He tried to join others for walking meditation, but he kept a very big distance; he walked behind us about thirty meters. He thought that if anything happened, he would have time to run for cover. Instead of staying in the dormitory with us, he camped in the forest and he set traps around his tent. That was our first retreat organized for war veterans in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the retreatants finally told us his story, that had never been told before. During a battle in Vietnam, most of his friends were killed in an operation, and he saw his companions die. So he got very angry. He wanted to retaliate. He brought out a number of sandwiches, he put explosives inside the sandwiches, he left them on the place where children would play, and he hid himself and watched. He saw children coming. They were very happy to see this kind of sandwich, and ate them. And just ten or fifteen minutes later, they began to scream, and their mothers came out, trying to get them to the hospital, but the American soldier knew that nothing could be done in order to help the children. He had wanted to do so out of his anger and the will to retaliate. Since the time he went back to America, he could not live with that kind of image in his store consciousness. He told us that every time he found himself together with a few children in a room, he had to run out of that room as quickly as possible. He just couldn’t bear it, for more than twelve years. His mother encouraged him to deal with the present time, to forget the war, the war was over; but for him, the war was never over. Until he came to the retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told him, “Yes, I know that you have killed children. You have ambushed them as your way to retaliate. I know you have caused suffering. But I want you to know also that there are many children who are dying around the world, everywhere. Many die just because they need just one medicine pill. Many children die because they need a glass of milk, soy milk. Many step on grenades and bombs that are left over there. If you know how to use your time, now, you can save many of them, even every day. You have the capacity of acting, of living in mindfulness, in compassion, and I know you will be able to save the lives of many children, now. Why don’t you make a determination to receive the First Precept of not killing, of protecting life? You receive that precept in the presence of the whole Sangha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And you take action right away. You go out and you save children who are dying in the present moment, children even in America. In America there are children who are dying every day because of stupid causes. Children in Southeast Asia, in Africa, everywhere. You know that you have an American passport. You can go almost everywhere, not like the boat people. The boat people, because they don’t have a piece of paper, they are thrown back to the sea and die; but you, you are different. You are an American citizen. You can go where you want, and you can help many children from dying. So make the determination. Receive the First Precept, and act.” And the teaching was already a drop of Dharma nectar. When a drop of Dharma nectar fell into his heart, it opened. He was transformed right away, in that moment. And he made the determination to receive the First Precept and to go out and help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, you become a bodhisattva with a lot of energy within you, and that is exactly the kind of energy that you need to heal. Why remain immobilized, paralyzed in your suffering? Why continue to be the victim of your sorrow? The Five Steps of Training can open up the door for you to transform your life, to transform the lives of living beings on Earth. Because that is the way of loving, protecting, and offering joy and peace. This is not an idea, this is not a dogma, this is not a promise. The Buddhadharma is something you can come and see by yourself, and touch by yourself. The healing can take place right away, the moment when you embrace the Dharma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A writer, a woman writer with a lot of talent, she came to me and confessed that she was abused as a little girl and she has carried that kind of suffering within her. She doesn’t feel that she’s a normal person. I helped her to practice. I said, “Sit down and practice looking with me. Are you angry at that person? Don’t you think that he was sick? It was only sick people who do that kind of thing to children and ruin their life. Do you see the suffering in that person, how that person has been brought up? There are many of them like that to be helped. You know, you are a writer. You can help these people. You can do more; you can help the children who are about to be molested by these people. You have the energy, the talent that you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to make the vow, the determination to receive the Third Precept: I am aware of the suffering caused by sexual misconduct in family circles. I have seen children molested and suffer for their whole life, and I now undertake to practice the Third Precept in order to protect the integrity of families, individuals, and children. I am determined to learn ways to do that with my Sangha, because I know that if I continue to recite the Five Steps of Training, to hold Dharma discussions with my Sangha, and learn better ways to practice them, then I will be able to help.” During a Precepts transmission ceremony, the Sangha is there with their best presence and they witness to the fact that you are undertaking the path. During that moment, transformation takes place already, because you receive a lot of energy the moment you decide to receive and practice the Steps of Training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bell]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healing takes place very quickly, and you put your heart into the practice. Concerning the Fourth Precept, we see that it is the art of deep listening and loving speech. We know that a lot of suffering has been created by our lack of capacity to listen deeply and with compassion to the other person. If there is no communication possible between you and her or him, that’s because you don’t practice; you are not able to listen with calm, with compassion. Avalokiteshvara is the one who shows the talent of listening deeply with compassion. When we evoke the name of Avalokiteshvara, we must be determined to learn his way of deep listening, compassionate listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to listen with calm and compassion, we should train ourselves in the art of mindful breathing, mindful walking, mindful sitting, so that every time we hear things that shock our ears, that are provocative, that go against our common sense, we will not get irritated. Because the moment we show our irritation at the anger, the other person will stop talking. So we have to listen in such a way that encourages the other person to continue to talk, because it’s very healing for him or for her. You are the best therapist if you know the art of compassionate listening. You listen because you have compassion; you want to relieve him or her of the suffering and not because you want to listen in order to analyze, or judge, or condemn, or correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compassionate listening is just to give the other person a chance to empty what is in their heart. Because he has had no one to listen to him, he has become more and more like a bomb, ready to explode; she also. So you are afraid of him, of her, you don’t want to approach, because you are afraid of the explosion. And as you try to avoid him or her, they think that we despise them, we want to boycott them and the suffering will increase. So the only alternative is to train ourselves in the art of deep listening, compassionate listening, and go to him or her to help. If you cannot do that, who in the world can? Because you may be the closest person to him or to her. So the Fourth Step of Training is about deep listening and using loving speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to practice that? Sit quietly, and maintain your mindful breathing, and nourish your compassion. Remind yourself that you are listening in order to relieve him or her of the suffering and not for anything else. Then when the other person says things that are wrong, incorrect, full of injustice, misunderstanding, you can continue to listen with serenity. That is the act of Avalokiteshvara. Many of us are able to do that after some time of practice and that is very healing. If at some point you feel that your capacity of listening has come to a limit, you cannot go on for another five minutes, so you have to bow and say “Darling, could we continue later on? I need to do something right now, I would love to continue to listen.” Don’t try too hard; because you should know your limit. I also practice that. I learn about my limits. I know that I should not try to do more than I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one thing I repeat over and over again to the people who attend retreats on helping professions: nurses and doctors and psychotherapists, social workers and so on. Because they see suffering a little bit too much, and they try too hard and they get burnt out very quickly. So you practice more, get refreshed, and then you offer another session of compassionate listening. If you are to explain to him or her about his or her misunderstanding, about your own suffering, then you should, we should, be able to use loving speech. We can tell the truth, but in such a way that the other person can see, can understand. We speak not for expressing our anger, just trying to help the other person to see. And that is why calm, serenity, and loving kindness should be there while we speak. Every time we feel some irritation coming up, we cannot swallow our suffering, and then we should stop. We should ask for another chance to do it; don’t continue. We should know our limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is about the Fourth Step of Training, the only kind of practice that can restore communication. That is something we have to practice as individuals, as partners, father and son, mother and daughter; and we have to practice as nation with nation, because our nation suffers, yes. But the other nation also suffers. We have to recognize that. We should not believe that we are the only nation that suffers. The other nation may be suffering at the same time, and on our part there may be misunderstanding, so we continue to blame each other and kill each other. The warring parties always do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is another nation that can come in and help, that’s wonderful. But helping here does not mean to take sides, but to help both sides to calm down, to be able to tell the other side of the suffering in this side. Loving speech and deep listening should be applied between nations. That is why at the United Nations you also need the practice of listening. At peace talks, we do need that kind of discipline; and that is something, I hope, that will be possible to start in the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerning the Fifth Precept, the Fifth Step of Training: Mindful consumption is the key word. Because you consume many things: food, drink, conversations, relationships, television, magazines, the so-called controlled items. Many of the items we consume contain toxins that bring war into our body and bring war into our consciousness, and water the negative seeds in us.There are so many kinds of food. Edible food ([ph: duan tuc]) is the first category of food. The second kind of food is [ph: sup tuc]: sense impressions. We open our eyes, our ear, our nose, our tongue, our body, our mind, to many kinds of foods. The sound, the image, the ideas, the touch, that we consume in our daily life can bring to us a lot of poisons and toxins. The Buddha said, suppose there is a cow that is seriously sick with a skin disease. [End of side three]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gap in tape]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Beginning of side four]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... suck the blood. If we bring the cow down to the water, tiny living beings in the water will come and cling to the cow and suck the blood. If you bring the cow close to a [circular?] tree, all the beings living in the bark of the tree will come out and stick to the cow to suck the blood. We human beings, we are like that in our daily life; we open wide our eyes, our nose, our tongue, our body, our mind, to that kind of touching. You just drive through the city, and all the things you see in the city -- the announcements, the commercials -- all these things become nutriments to your eyes, your ears. When you read, when you watch television, you are consuming. And you are very, very vulnerable, like the cow without skin. So poison just penetrates you like that, and you allow yourself to be poisoned like that in your daily life, and then you get the sickness, the suffering. So Mindfulness of consumption is the only way to protect yourself from ingesting poisons every day. Practice and protect yourself and protect your children from that kind of unmindful consumption. That is the Fifth Precept, very important. How could you get rid of your depression if you don’t practice the Fifth Step of Training?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Five Steps of Training are to be studied more deeply by Dharma discussions, so that we may learn better ways of practicing mindfulness: mindfulness of speech, mindfulness of listening, mindfulness of consumption, mindfulness of protecting life, and so on. Who is the author of the Five Steps of Training? Who has created them? It’s you yourself. It is our mindfulness that has brought about the insight of the Five Steps of Training. The Buddha was one of the people who have contributed to the art of mindful living. He proposed the Five Precepts, yes. But since that time, many generations have come and practiced, and contributed their insight in the practice. The Five Steps of Training as presented to you today are the fruit of many generations’ practice. If during your practice you find out other things, you have insight that can improve the way to present the Five Steps of Training, to modify the wording, then you are among the coauthors of the Five Steps of Training. This is not something imposed on us by a deity, by a god. This is a collective product of those who practice mindfulness, and out of their insight, they see the path, they see the Fourth Truth, the Truth about the path of liberation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of us who have practiced the Five Steps of Training, we see it as the way for the world to get out of these difficult situations. The Five Steps of Training are also instruments for dialogue with people of other spiritual traditions. This is the way we adopt so that a future would be possible for our children and their children. Have you tried something similar like this? What do you have to tell us, to help us to improve our practice? That is why during the conference organized by Gorbachev in San Francisco, the State of the World Forum, I did not talk much about other things. I just talked about mindful living and the Five Wonderful Precepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all of you who have received the Five Steps of Training, learned the art of mindful living, I hope that you have the opportunity to deepen your understanding of these Steps of Training. I hope that you will continue to have a Sangha where you are, so that you can continue to explore, to deepen your understanding. Then you’ll be able to share them with many people around you, so that we have a future for our children and their children for the twenty-first century, and don’t repeat the same kind of errors and mistakes that we have made during this twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now I see&amp;quot; means that until now, I did not see. Why not? I may have been looking for a very long time, but still I did not see. Perhaps because now I am not looking anymore, I begin to see. What is it that I see? What is it that I have been looking for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you were looking for yourself--to find out who you really are. Who is the person reciting the Buddha&amp;#39;s name? Who is it that is practicing meditation? Who is the one trying to look deeply?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The now is the only moment when and where you can find what you have been looking for. You have been looking for Nirvana. You have been looking for God. You have been looking for enlightenment, for awakening. You have been looking for Pure Land, and for your true nature of no birth and no death. It turns out that everything that you have been looking for is already there in the present moment, and the secret of the finding is to go back to the now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excerpt translation from &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Now I See&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; (&lt;em&gt;bây giờ mới thấy&lt;/em&gt;)* a new book in Vietnamese about poem by Thich Nhat Hanh.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Meditation on the Corn Seed&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;July 16, 2013. 81-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Upper Hamlet of Plum Village during the 2013 Summer Opening. This is the sixth talk of the summer and this is an English translation from the French. The recording begins with a talk for the children and then the main talk begins (at 18-minutes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditation on the corn seed. Meditation is having the time to look and to listen. There is knowledge in this seed and it is alive. Does the plant remember when it was a little seed? Has the corn seed died? Meditation can help us see things that other people cannot see. Looking into the corn plant we can see the seed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A teaching from the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing. The exercises of breathing are simple yet can be very profound on us. The first is &lt;strong&gt;recognizing&lt;/strong&gt;. Bringing our attention to our in-breath. We can let go of our past, of our projects, etc. and we can immediately be free. Buddhism is made of three kinds of energy: mindfulness, concentration, insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second exercise is to &lt;strong&gt;follow&lt;/strong&gt; the breath. We focus entirely on the in-breath and the out-breath. The third is awareness if body and then fourth we calm our body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next two are giving rise to a feeling of joy and happiness. We can do this anytime. The seventh exercise is recognizing a painful feeling. Then we calm the feeling in the eighth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art of happiness. The art of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Meditation on the Flame&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;July 19, 2013. 110-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from New Hamlet of Plum Village during the 2013 Summer Opening. This is the eighth talk of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: This talk coming slightly out of order as I catch up on the recordings. The sixth (July 16) and seventh (July 18) talk of summer will be posted soon. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching using the meditation on the flame. The flame is there but it is hidden. Maybe in the box? It is hidden by the conditions, and there are conditions that help the flame manifest. Where does the flame go? Her nature is no coming and no going. We know this with mindfulness, concentration, and insight. When conditions are no longer sufficient, the manifestation ceases to continue. The same is true for those we love. This is a very deep teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue the teaching on the Four Noble Truths. The first is dukkha, translated as ill-being/suffering. The second is the making of ill-being; how suffering is made. This is seeing the cause of our suffering. With the third, we have the cessation of ill-being. The path, or the way, leading to well-being is the the fourth. The Five Mindfulness Trainings contain this path and is called the Noble Eightfold Path that leads to healing and out of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right View&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right Thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right Speech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right Action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right Livelihood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right Diligence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right Mindfulness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right Concentration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Noble Truths in the context of mindful consumption and the fifth mindfulness training. Nothing can survive without food. In Buddhism, we speak of Four Kinds of Nutriments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edible Food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sense impression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consciousness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been taking mostly about the second and fourth noble truth so far. The talk continues here with looking more closely at Right View and the other elements if the path.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comme une montagne, je me sens libre et solide
Comme une montagne, je n&amp;#39;ai même plus peur du vide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;#39;ai mis un caillou dans ma poche, peut être même deux ou trois
J&amp;#39;ai mis un caillou dans ma poche et.........j&amp;#39;en ai un pour toi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C&amp;#39;est facile d&amp;#39;être heureux ici et maintenant
C&amp;#39;est facile d&amp;#39;être heureux, laisse-moi te montrer comment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;#39;ai mis un caillou dans ma poche, peut être même deux ou trois
J&amp;#39;ai mis un caillou dans ma poche et.........j&amp;#39;en ai un pour toi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pont:
le bonheur dépend de toi et moi / le bonheur ne s&amp;#39;achète pas
Le bonheur c&amp;#39;est inspirer ...n&amp;#39;oublie pas d&amp;#39;expirer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les fleurs de ton jardin ont les couleurs de demain
Les fleurs de ton jardin parfument les mots sur ton chemin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;#39;ai mis un caillou dans ma poche, peut être même deux ou trois
J&amp;#39;ai mis un caillou dans ma poche et.........j&amp;#39;en ai un pour toi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y&amp;#39;a une grenouille dans la mare, je crois que c&amp;#39;est toi qu&amp;#39;elle regarde
Elle n&amp;#39;a ni poche ni caillou, c&amp;#39;est encore une histoire de fou&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elle prend un caillou dans ta poche, peut être même deux ou trois
Elle prend un caillou dans ta poche et .....elle te sourit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pont:
le bonheur dépend de toi et moi / le bonheur ne s&amp;#39;achète pas

Nos cœurs sont reliés malgré l&amp;#39;espace entre nous deux&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Listening to the Bell and Walking Meditation&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;July 15, 2013. 96-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Upper Hamlet of Plum Village during the 2013 Summer Opening. This is the fifth talk of the summer and the beginning of the second week of the retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding suffering and listening to the chant. Invoking the name of Avalokiteshvara. The energy of compassion. Chant begins at 22-minutes followed by about 10-minutes of mindful movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main talk starts at 55-minutes into the recording. We begin with a 20-minute instruction on listening to the bell. How do we use the bell to practice mindfulness?. No talking and no thinking and we go back to our breathing. The bell is the voice of the Buddha. The voice of the Buddha inside. One in breath is enough to be free. One mindful breath. The bell is here to help call us back to our true home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking mediation  (1:17) is another foundational mediation practice. Every step is there to help you arrive in the here and the now. How can we walk on Mother Earth? Using a gatha to help us focus our concentration on walking.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Five Fingers Living in Harmony&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;July 12, 2013. 100-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from New Hamlet of Plum Village during the 2013 Summer Opening. This is the fourth talk of the summer and this is an English translation from the French. The recording begins with four chants followed by a talk for the children (at 16-minutes) and then the main talk begins (at 28-minutes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should plant this question in our heart. A question is a seed. It’s a lesson from when Thay was a boy. In my hand are five fingers and each finger has it’s name. They live in harmony. How are they a able to do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue from a few day ago (&lt;a href=&quot;http://tnhaudio.org/2013/07/16/offering-beauty-and-freshness/&quot;&gt;July 9&lt;/a&gt;) when we learned about the Sutra on the Full Awareness if Breathing.  The last time we covered the first eight exercises. First we review briefly with mind and store consciousness and the role of seeds. The practitioner had to be present I recognize the mental formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize each mental formation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beautify/Gladden the mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watering the good seeds, especially in our relationships. Maybe sign a peace and happiness treaty. How do we work with our mental formations to have a happy and healthy life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we try not to water the seeds of suffering.  Second, if a seed if suffering exists then we can invite a wholesome seed to manifest. Third, when a good seed is manifesting, we try to maintain the positive energy. Fourth, we try to keep the good seeds alive. This is the practice if right diligence. The art of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first aspect of the noble eightfold path is right view. The insight of interbeing acquired through meditation. This is followed by right thinking. Free of all notions. No discrimination. The third is right speech. With these we can practice loving speech and deep listening.  The Five Mindfulness Trainings are an expression of the Noble Eightfold Path.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Offering Beauty and Freshness&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;July 9, 2013. 103-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Upper Hamlet of Plum Village during the 2013 Summer Opening. This is the second talk of the summer and this is an English translation from the French. The recording begins with two chants followed by a talk for the children (ends at 12-minutes) and then the main talk begins (begins at 33:40-minutes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to say I love you? What is the most precious gift? We can offer &lt;strong&gt;beauty&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;freshness&lt;/strong&gt;. Meditation can help; the meditation on flower/fresh. How do we cultivate stability?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace in the body. Peace in the feelings. Peace in the perceptions. This is possible. Joy and happiness too. The practitioner should know how to generate these. What does it mean to cultivate? We need energy, and the first is &lt;strong&gt;mindfulness&lt;/strong&gt;. The next energy, and linked to mindfulness, is &lt;strong&gt;concentration&lt;/strong&gt;. And if these two are strong enough, we can bring about &lt;strong&gt;insight&lt;/strong&gt;. There are 16-exercises of mindful breathing that can help is cultivate these three energies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognizing breath is the first exercise. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following breath is the second exercise. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third is recognizing your body. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calming the body is the fourth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the next set of exercises we move from body to the realm of feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generating joy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generating happiness &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognizing a painful feeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calm the painful feeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion and explanation of habit energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now move to the realm of perceptions. The five universal mental formations: contact, attention, feeling, perception, volition. What are mental formations? Mind and store consciousness along with the manifestation of seeds. Buddhist psychology. Along with five universals are the five particulars: intention, determination, mindfulness, concentration, insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/spiritual-ecology.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;Showing the deep connection between our present ecological crisis and our lack of awareness of the sacred nature of creation, this series of essays from spiritual and environmental leaders around the world shows how humanity can transform its relationship with the Earth. Combining the thoughts and beliefs from a diverse range of essayists, this collection highlights the current ecological crisis and articulates a much-needed spiritual response to it. Perspectives from Buddhism, Sufism, Christianity, and Native American beliefs as well as physics, deep psychology, and other environmental disciplines, make this a well-rounded contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Children and their Experience of Divorce&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;July 11, 2013. 82-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Lower Hamlet in Plum Village during the 2013 Summer Opening. This is the third talk of the summer and it is a session of questions and answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does the world exist?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t understand about love because my parents got divorced and they yelled at each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does God look like to you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long are you/I going to live?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teens and Adults&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When parents get divorced, why do they fight in front of the children and also say they love the children?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a friend who is always unkind to me and then later he is concerned about me. Why does he do that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can have stillness and joy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can transform the guilt inside for my parents getting divorced?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t know how to deal with my anger, especially when I am angry. What can I do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I practice with my parents/grandparents when I haven’t met or seen him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A friend is on drugs. How can I deal with being overwhelmed by this person?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French Television&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the meaning of prayer in Buddhism?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the different kinds of prayer in Buddhism?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can prayer offer to humanity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Why do we practice walking meditation?&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;July 8, 2013. 100-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Upper Hamlet in Plum Village during the 2013 Summer Opening. This is the first talk of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: the brief segment at the beginning is missing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin with a 25-minute introduction on listening to the chant. The art of suffering. If we know how to suffer then we suffer much less. It’s like an organic gardener who knows it is useful to keep the garbage in order to nourish the flowers and vegetables. Understanding suffering is very important and we can use the energy of mindfulness to take care of our suffering. This is the heart of the Buddhist teaching. The first noble truth is there is suffering. The monks and the nuns will practice chanting this morning saying the name of Avalokiteshvara. They are getting in touch with the suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monks and nuns begin chanting the name Namo Avalokiteshvara from 25-minutes to 48-minutes. The main talk begins at 53-minutes into the recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As meditation practitioners, we should know how to generate peace, happiness, and joy. We can do this while walking, sitting, eating, drinking, etc. We can train ourselves. Listening to the bell is a reminder. Being alive in the present moment. It only takes 2-3 seconds to being mind and body together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a 30-minute explanation of how and why we do walking meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know how to handle the present moment then we are taking care of the future. I have arrived. I am home.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;June 16, 2013. 112-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from the European Institute of Applied Buddhism in Waldbrol, Germany. The talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into German. This is the final dharma talk of the German Retreat on the theme &lt;strong&gt;Are You Sure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start with the three kinds of energies — mindfulness, concentration, insight — and they can produced anytime while doing any activity. We can see things more deeply and remove wrong perceptions. Mindfulness is always mindfulness of something. Concentration is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Foundations of Mindfulness – the four domains or objects of mindfulness. The first domain is body. The second domain are the feelings. The mind is the third object. The final domain is objects of mind – in Buddhist psychology there are 51 mental formations. What is object of mind? The Five Skandhas (also known as the five aggregates). We discuss store consciousness and mind consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and Buddhism. Conventional truth and ultimate truth. Transmitter and receiver. What is emptiness? Birth and death. Being and non-being. These are just notions and can lead to wrong views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right View, part of the noble eightfold path, is the insight that is free from all wrong views. Right Thinking is the kind of thinking that is also free of notions of birth and death, being and non-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_**Dear Plum Village Siblings,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/upperhamlet&quot;&gt;Upper Hamlet&lt;/a&gt; enters the summer season with the trees and plants fully clothed in green and the graceful pathways surrounding the Thénac (Thệ Nhật Sơn) plateau are shaded once again. A few tents have already sprung up to be shelter for the early arrivals. Lay volunteers are slowly trickling in before the opening so as to settle ahead of the regular retreatants. We have only just returned from our month’s stay at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eiab.eu&quot;&gt;EIAB&lt;/a&gt; for about two weeks, yet the Hamlet seems so tidy and ready. Last Friday, Upper Hamlet hosted our annual Open House and Saturday, the New and Lower Hamlet followed suite to serve and be with our Dordognian neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Upper Hamlet Bhikkhu Council met this morning to finalize our summer schedule. It was a short and harmonious meeting. The Brotherhood could be felt concretely - alive and healthy. I sat, at moments, with eyes closed, just to enjoy this palpable energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Spring has seen many new spiritual leaves sprout, a sign that our community is growing. At present, there are about twenty young men practicing as long term-ers. We have five young ones aspiring for monastic life – from Thailand, America, Poland, England, and Spain. In the last two years that I have been in PV, I have seen more and more this shift in the last three or four novice ordinations; that is, non-Asians, Caucasians, Europeans are aspiring more with an occasional Asian; at least this is so here in Plum Village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All around the hamlet, many Brothers have noticeably stepped up their practice, in terms of walking without talking, gently and happily; and the evenings are quietly noble, enough so as not to be too stifling, even on the lazy nights. In the spirit of service, Brother Pháp Tại replaced Pháp Áo as work coordinator this season – a delight for everyone to see him about the hamlet delegating work with the best of his English. Brother Pháp Đan renovated the Bamboo Hall for use as the temple office for monastics. This project has brought smiles to the Brothers because we can already see that it will be a joy to work in this space – being together, spacious and with a low tea table for breaks and even a beautiful sink to wash our cups! The Children’s Program Team composed of Brother Pháp Lưu, Pháp Tài and Pháp Lý, brought home a 9 meter yurt that will be used as meditation room for the children. The owner/saler, in fact, with two others, is installing it at this moment. It’s the second yurt to be raised in our Plum Village centers after Deer Park’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2136&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;282&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/happy-farm-team.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Happy Farm - from left to right: Br. Stuart Watson, Br. Keith, Br. Daniel[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon our return from Germany, we have been enjoying the fresh organic vegetables from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/pvhappyfarm&quot;&gt;Happy Farm&lt;/a&gt;, from the hearts and hands of Br. Stuart, Br. Daniel, Br. Keith and many others. Our meals have been vibrant with mixed salad, baby yellow squash, kale, zucchini, bokchoi, broccoli, cauliflower, and many other vegetables. I think this is the first time our community has successful grown such full cauliflowers. The rows of potatoes are still ripening, with more sun and heat, their dark green leaves hold a promise for us this summer. I have noticed that when the Brothers know that the vegetables have been grown organically by our community, they prepare them more carefully and simply so as to retain its flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much more joyous progress to report around the hamlets, but I will move to sharing about our experience in Germany, where we hosted two six-day retreats and a day of mindfulness. The bell tower has finally been raised and the garden surrounding it brings new light and energy to the grounds. Here’s one to phong-thủy (fengshui) Thầy Pháp Ấn! The two retreats, a Dutch and a German speaking, once again was transformational and rewarding. It is hard to believe that the EIAB was just established about five years ago. The Vietnamese Brothers and Sisters have mostly passed all their exams with just one last group to be tested this Fall. It was inspirational to see a lot of our Brothers and Sisters speak so fluently during the arrival day and throughout the retreat. Sister Bói Nghiêm and Thúc Nghiêm shared beautifully in our dharma discussion group, expressing completely their thoughts and viewpoints. I was impressed with Sister Bói’s sharing because two years ago, I had a chance to attend a few classes with her and others, and I remember her German then was quite diffident. I joked with them that in ten or twenty years, when we can organize a reunion with their other Bat Nha siblings, it will interesting to discover how much they have transformed and adapted to their differing environments – some having grown in America, some, in Thailand, in Hong Kong, and even in Australia now; truly, they are transplants from the Bat Nha nursery (Vườn Ươm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around at the EIAB, there seemed to be less talk about the money, the fund raising, the ‘having to get the whole building fixed soon’ sharings and the stress that goes along with it. The Sangha seemed more settled and at ease. Undoubtedly, the experiences, gathered from the last five years have brought fruits, helping the retreat flow more smoothly. I took care of the Dutch and German staff, who complimented the way the retreat unfolded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2144&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/atme-du-lebst-300x168.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; EIAB: Atme du lebst ~ Breathe You Are Alive[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something hit me this time in Germany. I realized that our community will never become perfect and will never come to a place or time where or when we can sit back and say, “well, it’s all done now” or “now that’s done, we can relax and practice”. I am aware of the amount of investment that this institute might require as we grow, but it is here now and the retreats are blooming, the courses are sprouting, and the Brothers and Sisters are growing. “Happy enough” should be a mantra or “Good enough for Now”. This time around, I was more aware of the transformation that was taking place and what this institute’s role in contributing to this. Its history, its domineering presence, its stoical loom has a challenge for us and for all those who come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard a woman from Hungary share on the very first dinner gathering on arrival day that she was upset that no one told her about the history of this place. She felt it was our responsibility to inform our guests of such matter of importance. It was clear from her face that she was suffering terribly. Her sharing hinted a lot of family suffering involved with the German war, a past that her family has adamantly avoided mentioning with each other. She even thought about leaving the retreat. But then she stayed. She smiled. She cried. She left feeling positive and gave everyone a hug in our family for being there for her. Karma is alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in the right place and at the right time. It’s not about the building, or about the money, or even about how well the retreats are run and how many we should have and so on. This woman found something. Not gold. Not diamonds. How much does it cost to invest in her transformation? Is it worth it, our tiring efforts? I think of &lt;a href=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/about/thich-nhat-hanh/&quot;&gt;Thầy&lt;/a&gt; and Sư Cô &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan_Khong&quot;&gt;Chân Không&lt;/a&gt; (Sr. Ture Emptiness) and their efforts in Việt Năm and beyond. I am sure they were tired. I am speaking now to the lazy one in myself, the one that retreats and tries to find comfort and avoid challenges and difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2146&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/deerpark-300x225.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Deer Park Monastery - California[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://deerparkmonastery.org/&quot;&gt;Deer Park&lt;/a&gt; for 10 years and now in Plum Village for 2 years now. Who could have imagined what could have happened in these 10 years – our US Centers, Bat Nha, Hong Kong, Thailand, the EIAB, our diverse community, Wake-Up and …? I practice to use my 10-Year Eyes that show me that I know nothing as to what is to come. It reminds me to remain open to the infinite possibility, at least to the next 10 years. Not knowing helps me enjoy the present situation as it is. Thầy has recently written a book by his own hand if you haven’t already heard through the grape vine. I happened on a copy and it moved me to tears. I know it will soon be in all our hands. Its title is “Now I See” – a meditation on time based on the poetic lines from Kiều and inspired by Dogen’s Being Time. I share this because it indirectly inspired me to write this letter; and I will end here, to say thank you my dear Siblings for being on the path. I will stay now, thus I will stay for the next Ten Years. See you along the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly, outside my window, my young brothers are shooting hoops. You can’t think of the past or the future while playing basketball. To really play, you have to just play. Maybe, we can ask Thầy to add playfulness as an added mental formation. All children can touch this. Adults forget, but can still remember. With a little help. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you on the Court,&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Questions and Answers – German Retreat&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;June 15, 2013. 85-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from the European Institute of Applied Buddhism in Waldbrol, Germany. The talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into German. This is the fourth dharma talk, a session of questions and answers, of the German Retreat on the theme &lt;strong&gt;Are You Sure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who are we if we are not our feelings, body, perceptions, or consciousness? What is left?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it okay to suffer and feel for my son who was paralyzed in an accident?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What makes a man a man and what makes a woman a woman? Is it important to know the distinction? What should we teach our children?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is no thinker then how can there be a doer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do work with feelings of pain, guilt, and shame?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to reconcile, how can I call my father if he’s dead?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you help someone who is suffering from violent emotions, especially if they can’t see it themselves?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Teaching on Consumption and the Fifth Training&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;June 14, 2013. 87-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from the European Institute of Applied Buddhism in Waldbrol, Germany. The talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into German. This is the third dharma talk of the German Retreat on the theme Are You Sure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Following two chants by the monastics, the talk begins at 16-minutes into the recording.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we can be sure of is that there is suffering in yourself and the world. From here, the Buddha built his practice and teaching. Nothing can be by itself alone, it must inter-be with something else. Suffering is the First Noble Truth. Dukkha is ill-being, but we must confirm its opposite as well. This is the Third Noble Truth – the existence of well-being. This way of thinking is the opposite of dualist of thinking and based on Interbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we explain interbeing? A further explanation of the Four Noble Truths along with a teaching on consumption in relationship to these Truths. In our community, it is the Fifth Mindfulness Training that shows a way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything requires food. What are we feeding ourselves? According to the Buddha, there are Four Kinds of Nutriments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edible food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sensory impressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consciousness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;What is Right Thinking&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;June 12, 2013. 102-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from the European Institute of Applied Buddhism in Waldbrol, Germany. The talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into German. This is the first dharma talk of the German Retreat on the theme &lt;strong&gt;Are You Sure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Following two chants by the monastics, the talk begins at 12-minutes into the recording. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin immediately with the concept of dualist thinking and Right Thinking. How do we see the interconnection between things? For example, between happiness and suffering or all the elements of a lotus flower. The lotus is made of non-lotus elements. A good gardener knows how to make good use of the mud just as a good mindfulness practitioner knows how to make good use of her suffering. The goodness of suffering. When you understand suffering then understanding and compassion arises – the foundation of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing, we have exercises handed down by the Buddha to help our practice with suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate a feeling of joy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate a feeling of happiness &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize painful feelings &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calm down the painful feeling &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness is an energy that helps us know what is going on in our body and our feelings. How do we bring relief to our painful feelings and emotions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three kinds of energies we should try to generate: mindfulness, concentration, and insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four elements of True Love and being present for those we love. Taking care of our suffering and our live we can learn to take care of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last 10-minutes, we get walking meditation instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Using our Breath brings Mindfulness&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;June 9, 2013. 100-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from the European Institute of Applied Buddhism in Waldbrol, Germany. The talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into Dutch. This is the fifth dharma talk of the Dutch Retreat on the theme Understanding Our Emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not need to call ourselves a Buddhist to practice Buddhism. We can use practice verses, little poems, to help us with our practice. Thay shares a number of these verses for us to memorize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness is an energy that lets us do at least two things. The first is to be there – to be truly here in the present moment. The second is to be aware of what is going on – such as your in breath. We can use mindfulness to take care of the body. In the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing, the Buddha gave a set of exercises on mindfulness of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aware of my breath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow your in breath all the way to the end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To beware of your body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release the tension in the body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are simple exercises and anyone can practice. After we take care of our body, we can move on to our feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate a feeling of joy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate a feeling of happiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awareness of the painful feeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calm the painful emotions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the body and the feelings, we move to taking care of the mind. In particular, working with mental formations. What is a mental formation? Thay also shares a little about the Shining Light Ceremony and how we can use this with our practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gladdening the mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aware of mental formations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concentrating the mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liberating your mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last four exercises of the sutra have to do with the objects of mind. We conclude with teachings on birth and death, being and non-being.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Working with our Relationships&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;June 8, 2013. 91-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from the European Institute of Applied Buddhism in Waldbrol, Germany. The talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into Dutch. This is the fourth dharma talk, a session of questions and answers, of the Dutch Retreat on the theme Understanding Our Emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Following two chants by the monastics, the questions begin at 15-minutes into the recording. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question about the Third Mindfulness Training as it relates to sexual behavior and consumption. How can we integrate and explore our sexual behavior as true love or as consumption?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another question on true love. Can true love exist between every person I meet and in every relationship even after a relationship ends? Is there something else or can I cultivate true love for every person?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the four elements of true love is inclusiveness. How do I combine love and career choices?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my relationships, I’ve always had a difficult time committing and my partner doesn’t feel I am there for her. What can I do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like the statement of being able to always generate a feeling of joy. This hasn’t been my experience and so I need help knowing more about generating joy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question about the First Mindfulness Training especially in regards to compassion and relieving the suffering of animals, especially for those who are dependent on us. Is it okay to end the suffering of an animal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Cultivating Brotherhood and Sisterhood&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;June 7, 2013. 106-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from the European Institute of Applied Buddhism in Waldbrol, Germany. The talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into Dutch. This is the third dharma talk of the Dutch Retreat on the theme Understanding Our Emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This talk begins a few minutes into the recording and we listen to two chants from the monastic sangha. The main talk begins at 16:49 on the recording. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin with some history on the Plum Village monastic community. Though most monastics ordain for life, we also hear about the 5-year monastic program. What is the process for becoming a monastic? There are four aspects to monastic life: to study, to practice, to work, and to play. The monastics seek to find joy in all these aspects. We cultivate brotherhood and sisterhood. If you’re under forty, you may want to try monastic life in our 5-year program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far in this retreat we have only spoken of negative and destructive emotions. But there are also constructive emotions such as lovingkindness and compassion. They are very powerful emotions that have the power to heal and transform. True love is made of four elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lovingkindness (maitri) – friendship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compassion (karuna)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joy (mudita)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equanimity or inclusiveness (upeksha)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side we have emotions such as fear, anger, despair, and discrimination. This is the kind mud that can help grow the lotus of the four kinds of love. We can come to understand the nature of our own suffering. The Buddha has also spoken on nourishment – “Nothing can survive without food.” – your love also needs to be fed or it will die. The Buddha taught on the Four Nutriments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edible Food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sensory impressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consciousness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/love-letter-to-the-earth.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;While many experts point to the enormous complexity in addressing issues ranging from the destruction of ecosystems to the loss of millions of species, Thich Nhat Hanh identifies one key issue as having the potential to create a tipping point. He believes that we need to move beyond the concept of the &amp;quot;environment,&amp;quot; as it leads people to experience themselves and Earth as two separate entities and to see the planet only in terms of what it can do for them. Thich Nhat Hanh deems it vital that we recognize and respond to the stress we are putting on the Earth if civilization is to survive and shows that mindfulness and a spiritual revolution are needed to protect nature and limit climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love Letter to the Earth is a hopeful book that gives us a path to follow by showing that change is possible only with the recognition that people and the planet are ultimately one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISBN: 978-1-937006-38-9, Paperback, 144 pages.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Working with Fear&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;June 6, 2013. 59-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from the European Institute of Applied Buddhism in Waldbrol, Germany. The talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into Dutch. This is the second dharma talk of the Dutch Retreat on the theme Understanding Our Emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay begins with a story of when he first came to the west to teach and shares his ideas of what he thought he would do in the west. Thay shares about when he began to ordain students and why. When we create a connection with our teacher or our sangha we can use that energy to support us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this retreat you are invited to master your method of walking so that you can arrive in the here and the now. If you can accomplish this, you can bring this back home with you. The Kingdom of God is available in the here and now. Suffering has a role and an importance in our kingdom. Thay teaches of the goodness of suffering, just like a lotus needs the mud. We need to know how to use our suffering. A good practitioner never tries to run away from suffering. We use the energy of mindfulness to recognize and to hold our suffering. We can ask our friends to help us with this practice. This is why it’s so important to have a sangha in your practice. One of the most noble things we can do is build a sangha. The sangha create a powerful energy that can heal and transform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay shares the story of his teaching tour at the time of 9/11 and how much fear was present in America. How do we calm down our fear? In the Buddhist tradition, there is a practice called compassionate listening. This can help people suffer less. We also have the practice of loving speech.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Retreat on Understanding Our Emotions&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;June 5, 2013. 53-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eiab.eu/&quot;&gt;European Institute of Applied Buddhism&lt;/a&gt; in Waldbrol, Germany. The talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into Dutch. This is the first dharma talk of the Dutch Retreat on the theme Understanding Our Emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: We had a number of technical difficulties with the recording for this talk and so portion of it are missing. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handling emotions. Using mindfulness. Recognizing fear and anger. Using our breath and step to practice mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Buddhist psychology, we speak of seeds. Seeds in our consciousness. What are they? Store consciousness and mental formations.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;To Connect&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;May 26, 2013. 86-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Hong Kong. The sangha is on the spring Asian Tour and this talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into Chinese. The theme of the retreat is Happiness is the Way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we connect with the Buddha? How do we bow to the Buddha? Emptiness. Right View is the ultimate aim of practice. To gain insight into Interbeing and emptiness. What is &lt;strong&gt;emptiness&lt;/strong&gt;? How does this help us remove anger and discrimination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concentration allows us to discover this insight. These three practices (samadhi) to Right View are available in all Buddhist traditions. Emptiness. &lt;strong&gt;Signlessness&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Aimlessness&lt;/strong&gt;. These are the &lt;strong&gt;Three Doors of Liberation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness. Concentration. Insight. A good practitioner can generate these three kinds of energy. If we practice, we can produce Right Thinking and the Noble Eightfold Path. We are free if the notions of being and non-being. We hear the story of Anapindika when he was dying and how Sariputra helped him understand no birth and no death.&lt;/p&gt;

Take a step, touch the Earth. Don&amp;#39;t you feel the stream?
And you&amp;#39;ll be free...you are free&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the heart of great beings, there is a stream
Let it flow, let it be the ground of your being

You are love...you are love&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;To Meditate is to Look Deeply&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;May 25, 2013. 87-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Hong Kong. The sangha is on the spring Asian Tour and this talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into Chinese. The theme of the retreat is &lt;em&gt;Happiness is the Way&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To meditate is having the time is to look deeply. We first take the body. This is the object of our meditation. Mindfulness of body. We review briefly the realms of  the exercises on breathing: Breath, Feelings, and Mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus of the talk is on the mind. We start with the concept of mental formations. How do we work with and identify our mental formations. To meditate also means we sit at the river of mental formations and recognize each as they go by. What is store consciousness and mind consciousness? We can water the good seeds in our consciousness. Let us vow to water the good seeds in ourselves and in the other person. The practice of selective watering. The practice of Right Diligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us through the for ten exercises from the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Mindful Breathing. There are six more but we’ll continue another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk shifts to the Fifth Mindfulness Training (35-m) on consumption. The Sutra on the Flesh of the Son illustrates consumption. It speaks on four kinds of Nutriments. The first is &lt;strong&gt;edible food&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is &lt;strong&gt;sensory impressions&lt;/strong&gt;. How do we consume media, products, etc. The third is &lt;strong&gt;volition&lt;/strong&gt;. What is your deepest desire? The fourth food is &lt;strong&gt;consciousness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teaching of Interbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;The Other Person&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;May 24, 2013. 84-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Hong Kong. The sangha is on the spring Asian Tour and this talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into Chinese. The theme of the retreat is &lt;em&gt;Happiness is the Way&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay has a few questions to ask the audience and the questions might touch something very deep in you. It is about the “the other person” in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you in love? Are you still in love? Do you want to reconnect with the person you used to love? Do you think that he or she is happier than you are now? Do you have the time for each other or are you both to busy? Have you been able to preserve your freshness and beauty for yourself and for the other person? Are you capable to offer him or her freshness and beauty everyday? Do you know how to handle the suffering in yourself? Are you able to help handle the suffering in the other person? Do you understand your own suffering and the roots of that suffering? Are you able to understand the suffering in the other person? Do you have the capacity to help the other person suffer less? Have you learned the way to calm down the painful feelings and emotions? Do you have the time to listen to yourself, your suffering, your difficulties, and your deepest desire? Do you have the time to listen to him or her and help him or her to suffer less? Do you know the Buddhist way of restoring communication and bringing reconciliation? Are you capable of creating a feeling of joy and happiness for yourself? Are you capable of helping the other person to create a feeling of joy and happiness? Do you really think you have a clear spiritual path to go? Do you have the feeling of peace and contentment within yourself? Do you know to nourish your love everyday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to create a meditation hall on a bus or train and then use the time to nourish and heal yourself. You can use the exercises from the Anapanasati Sutta. The first exercise is to &lt;strong&gt;become aware&lt;/strong&gt; of your in-breath and your out-breath. We can cultivate energy to help heal and nourish. The first energy is &lt;strong&gt;mindfulness&lt;/strong&gt;. This energy can be cultivated with just one in-breath. The second energy we can generate during breathing is &lt;strong&gt;concentration&lt;/strong&gt;. The third energy is &lt;strong&gt;insight&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a kind of vision/wisdom that will help liberate you from suffering. This is enlightenment itself – it can come in just a few seconds! To be alive is a true wonder, a true miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am alive. Stop the thinking. Enjoy breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second exercise is to &lt;strong&gt;follow&lt;/strong&gt; your in-breath and your out-breath all the way through. With the third exercise, you become &lt;strong&gt;aware &lt;/strong&gt;that you have a body. Next we &lt;strong&gt;calm&lt;/strong&gt; our body and &lt;strong&gt;release &lt;/strong&gt;the tension and restore peace. Even if we only have a few minutes, we can use these exercises to restore ourselves. &lt;strong&gt;Generating joy&lt;/strong&gt; is the fifth exercise. Next we become aware of the painful emotion that in us – we don’t try to run away from our pain. From here we calm down the pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding suffering always bring compassion. We can restore communication with &lt;em&gt;the other person&lt;/em&gt; and end suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Vesak Talk in Hong Kong&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;May 19, 2013. 32-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from the Lotus Pond Temple in Hong Kong. The sangha is on the spring Asian Tour and this talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into Chinese. This is a Day of Mindfulness celebrating vesak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birth story of Siddhartha and the relationships in the family that effected his birth. Siddhartha left shortly after the birth of Rahula, his own son, in her to search for the way. He was doing that for all of us – his father, his mother, his country. When you become a monk or a nun, you do so for more than just yourself. He found a way to reduce tension in his body, to calm down his feelings,  to see the deep roots of suffering in himself and other people, found a way to restore communication, and most importantly the nature of no-birth and no-death. Today we celebrate Siddhartha’s birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddha saw that happiness is possible and it’s made of understanding and love. It only takes a short time to learn this path. We can learn to release the tension in our body, to calm our painful feeling and emotions, to learn how to generate a feeling of joy and happiness, and to understand the suffering in oneself and in the other person. We can use the Sutra on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shakyamuni is a Teacher and not a God.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Touch the Earth and Begin Anew&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article appearing on p. 12 of the Southern German Newspaper, the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Saturday-Sunday 1st-2nd June 2013.
Based on an interview given in August 2012 at the EIAB. Translated from German.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Buddhist Master Thich Nhat Hanh on suffering, hope and good business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interview by &lt;strong&gt;Malte Conradi&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Raich&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Thay-portrait-150x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;Waldbröl- If Yoda, the wise master from “Star Wars,” had been based on a person from real life, he would have been based on this man.
Kindly smiling, Thich Nhat Hanh, 86, is sitting on the floor of a meditation room [hall], his head shaven, wearing the brown jacket of a Buddhist novice [sic], a small teapot of freshly brewed green tea before him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small, gentle man is considered to be the most significant representative of Buddhism after the Dalai Lama.
He was forced to leave his native home of Vietnam in 1969 when his pleas for reconciliation in the middle of the Vietnam war displeased the communists in power. He lives in exile in the south of France where he teaches Buddhism to Westerners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a year he comes to Germany to teach monks, nuns and lay people in the Rhineland province. Interviews? There is rarely time for them. And if there is time for an interview, his disciples take advantage of the opportunity to listen to him speak.
After 90 minutes Thich Nhat Hanh is still sitting calmly in the lotus position, his back erect [lit: straight as a candle, Kerzengerade] - while his guests’ joints are all aching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SZ&lt;/strong&gt;: You have witnessed a lot of suffering in your life. How did you manage not to lose hope?
&lt;strong&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Yes, I have witnessed a lot of suffering, especially during the Vietnam war. At that time, I was helping to build a village for refugees in the demilitarized zone when it was bombed by the Americans because Vietcong were hiding there. So we rebuilt it. Then it was bombed again. So we rebuilt it again. Once again it was demolished. The third time we discussed if we should rebuild it again. It was my belief that if we gave up, people would lose all hope. So we rebuilt the houses again a third time, then a fourth time and finally a fifth time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SZ&lt;/strong&gt;: But where did you get the strength to do that?
&lt;strong&gt;TNH&lt;/strong&gt;: _We try to transform suffering into something good. Even a lotus flower needs mud in order to grow. It can’t grow on marble. You have to recognize that there is a close connection between suffering and happiness. If you run away from suffering, you cannot find happiness. On the contrary, we should try to identify the roots of our suffering. Only then can we gain understanding and cultivate compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two things are the key to happiness. All the money and power in the world will not bring happiness unless there is understanding and compassion. The only thing that helps in the face of fanaticism, oppression, fear and anger is looking deeply into the mud in order to allow a lotus flower to grow. If you can recognize the suffering of your aggressor, you don’t need to hate him._&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SZ&lt;/strong&gt;: Today you invite Westerners to your monasteries in order to spread these teachings. What exactly do you do there?&lt;strong&gt;
TNH&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;You do not need to be a Buddhist in order to apply our practice. We call it mindfulness. This is the art of living in the present moment, a kind of energy you can create. Mindfulness helps people to release tension and sorrow and to enjoy their lives more. They learn how to deal with their suffering, their anger, their confusion. After attending one of our seminars [retreats], they know how to create more joy and peace in their lives, how to reestablish communication with others. We might be called Buddhist, but actually our work is universal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SZ&lt;/strong&gt;: That sounds rather abstract.
&lt;strong&gt;TNH&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Oh, it’s actually very simple. For example, when you walk from your parking lot to the office, you stop thinking in that moment. You walk only with your feet, not with your head, step for step. It takes practice, but walking like this brings you back to the here and now and makes you a free person. Enjoy every step. When you get to your office you will be able to make good decisions. It is so simple, really. You see, the practices are very concrete. And after only a few days they bring change [transformation] and healing. You can experience this for yourself.
&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;SZ&lt;/strong&gt;: But people have so many things to think about, so much pressure, so many worries. How can you relax on the way to work?
&lt;strong&gt;TNH&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;I would like to tell you a story about that. A while back I met a young woman called Laura. Her husband, Frederik, was a successful businessman. Although they had everything, Laura was not happy because they didn’t have any time for each other or for their son. Frederik only had time for work. At first she was proud of him, but she soon began to feel lonely. She tried many things, went back to university and got a degree, organized charity events. But it didn’t help. She often cried at night. Frederik insisted that nobody could replace him at work. He said that maybe in three years’ time he would be able to work less. But three years later he was still working just as much. He wasn’t even able to come to the hospital when his son had an operation. Then one day Frederik had a car accident. He died. Three days later someone else was doing his job. This happens to many. We have to wake up. Now. Not in three years. We shouldn’t sacrifice our happiness today for the future!
&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;SZ&lt;/strong&gt;: Why is there such an interest in your teachings in the West?
&lt;strong&gt;TNH&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;We are experiencing a deep crisis, particularly in the West. People are running away from their sorrows, they are afraid. This is why they are consuming more and more: music, alcohol, food, the Internet. They do not consume because they need these things but because they cannot stand their loneliness, the emptiness within. We are afraid our sorrow may overwhelm us if we look it straight in the face. But the sorrow keeps growing. We are filled with regrets about the past, and fears and worries about the future. The practice of mindfulness helps us. When we let go of the past and the future, we free ourselves from our suffering.
&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/touch_the_earth1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SZ&lt;/strong&gt;: You have been living in the West for 50 years. Has this changed your work?
&lt;strong&gt;TNH&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;When I was forced into exile after [sic] the Vietnam war, I first had to get used to the Western way of thinking and doing things. That helped me to present the teachings in such a way that the Western mind could easily understand. I avoid using Buddhist terms; we prefer to express ourselves very simply. For example, “to repent” is a very heavy term. So we speak about touching the earth. We touch the earth and begin anew, we leave the past behind. Today we even translate some of these terms back into Vietnamese. Everywhere we use a new language in order to reach young people. People in the West like our teachings because there are not too many rituals. We shouldn’t overload the teachings with a lot of theory and complexity. It’s all about our daily life. By the way, the same applies to Christianity. Only a renewed Christianity can serve people in modern life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SZ&lt;/strong&gt;: Reformers are rarely welcomed by conservatives.
&lt;strong&gt;TNH&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;That’s right. As a young monk I also had difficulties with conservative Buddhists. I even had to leave my own monastery. So together with friends I created a new one, in the middle of the jungle. But in Buddhism we are only loosely organized, we do not have a sort of Vatican. So we are also not at risk of being excommunicated.
&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;SZ&lt;/strong&gt;: You have published over 100 books. How have you managed to do that?
&lt;strong&gt;TNH&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;We do it together. Like a river. Our motto is: Be part of the river, not a drop of water. Flow with the river. We do not have individual heroes. Many books are not written by me at all [sic]: a brother or a sister takes notes of one of my talks, another one puts it into form. We make decisions collectively: we discuss a problem together first, then someone makes a suggestion for a solution. If you agree, you remain silent. If you have a different opinion, you speak up. We ask three times if everyone agrees. If everyone remains silent three times, the decision is passed. This is the way we do business. Everyone could do like this, even businesses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SZ&lt;/strong&gt;: Are you a good businessman?
&lt;strong&gt;TNH&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Yes. We have found a good basic principle for our business life: joy and happiness should be the most important thing. Without this, a lot of money is not much use. If we work wholeheartedly and with joy, we succeed in our work. And our business will be successful. But our goal is not money- it’s community.
&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;SZ&lt;/strong&gt;: You seem to be completely content. Are you never unhappy?
&lt;strong&gt;TNH&lt;/strong&gt;: (&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;em&gt;You haven’t listened well, young man! [You haven’t understood what I have said.] Happiness is not possible without sadness and suffering. Not even I can grow lotus flowers on marble.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;by Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Thay-portrait-150x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;Queen Mahamaya had a very easy labor when she gave birth to Siddhartha. On the way to her parents’ home to give birth, she and her entourage stopped to rest in the Lumbini garden. While taking a walk in the garden, she felt the moment of birth coming. She held onto a branch of the Aśoka tree and, while standing, gave birth to Prince Siddhartha. Her attendants promptly received and cared for the baby with the necessary equipment. After giving birth to Siddhartha, Queen Mahamaya returned to Kapilavastu. Some attendants were sent home before her to inform both maternal and paternal sides of the family of the good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Yasodhara gave birth to Rahula, Siddhartha’s son, she encountered, however, a lot of difficulties. It was a prolonged labor. At times, it was feared that mother and son would not be able to make it through those hardest moments. The royal family, including Siddhartha, were extremely worried . The collective energy of anxiety was so great that it spread throughout the whole palace. Fortunately, Yasodhara finally gave birth to Rahula. We can see that, during Yasodhara’s pregnancy, Siddhartha was unsettled and had a lot of anxiety. He was unable to be happy in the present moment. Experiencing suffering himself, witnessing the suffering of the royal family as well as that of the people in his country, it was not possible for Siddhartha to enjoy all the favorable conditions of a luxurious and comfortable life. Yasodhara was aware of Siddhartha’s afflictions, yet she did not know how to help him. The suffering in Siddhartha’s heart had also penetrated into Yasodhara, as well as the baby Rahula. Her difficult childbirth was partly due to this reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That ordeal of childbirth, in some way, contributed to Siddhartha’s decision to leave home in search for his spiritual path. Yasodhara understood and accepted this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucky for all of us, Siddhartha was successful. His success was also a great success for humankind, similar to when Neil Armstrong put his first step on the moon. He declared that it was a great step for humankind in the field of science and technology. Siddhartha succeeded for all of us. Siddhartha found a way to help us handle our suffering, to generate peace and happiness in our daily life, to overcome the bonds of fame, wealth, power and sensual pleasures; as well as to touch the nature of no birth no death of all existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we celebrate the appearance of Siddhartha on this planet. However, the majority of us only worship Siddhartha as a supreme sacred power with the ability to bless and to protect us from danger. Not many are able to walk the path he has walked, to handle suffering, generate happiness, reestablish communication and touch Nirvana in the present moment. Our Buddhism of today mostly is a Buddhism of devotion. What the Buddha advised us—to let go of such things as fame and sensual pleasures—we now ask him to grant us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practicing mindfulness, concentration and insight, walking the Noble Eightfold Path as the path of happiness in the present moment, has become only a very small part of Buddhism as it is practiced today. We did not inherit the most precious parts of the spiritual heritage that Siddhartha left. Our Buddhism has become corrupted, unable to play its original role. We need to put all our heart into renewing Buddhism, so that it can continue to play its role in generating peace for individuals, families, countries and societies. By only practicing devotional Buddhism, bowing our heads amidst incense all day long, we will not able to do that—and not be worthy to be called descendents of the Buddha—the Great Conqueror of Afflictions.&lt;/p&gt;

Hyemin, a Korean Buddhist monk and bestselling author, during a televised show at the BTN studio in Seoul, Tuesday. / Yonhap[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Yun Suh-young&lt;/em&gt;
Most of the sufferings people experience in relationships are not really caused by others but themselves, says Vietnam’s celebrated Zen Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh. His visit garnered rapt attention in a country where “healing” has become a buzzword as people look for ways to make their overstressed lives healthier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Listening to and understanding our inner sufferings will resolve most of the problems we encounter,” said Nhat Hanh during a three-hour talk held at the Jamsil Indoor Stadium in Seoul, Monday evening, under the theme “Stop and Heal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh, who arrived in Seoul on May 1 as part of a global trip to celebrate Buddha’s birthday which falls on May 17, will be finishing off his official schedule in Korea today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In order to heal others, we first need to heal ourselves. And to heal ourselves, we need to know how to deal with ourselves,” said Nhat Hanh, who is also an influential poet and human rights activist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we know how to go back to ourselves, listen and heal, we can change. But most of us don’t know how to listen to ourselves and understand the sufferings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fast-paced contemporary society, people tend to be reluctant to confront the roots of their sufferings and try to conceal their distress with material consumption, Nhat Hanh observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our thoughts, speech and action are what cause anger, fear, and suspicion of the other side. So we can’t blame others. We should use language that can help the other side understand better. We should not condemn, accuse or blame while listening to them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the strained relations between the two Koreas, Nhat Hanh claimed Pyongyang’s pursuit of nuclear weapons was not the root cause of diplomatic difficulty, but fear, anger and suspicion between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nuclear weapons are an obstacle for a good relationship between the South and the North. It reflects the fear, anger, and suspicion in us. If we don’t have anger or fear, we wouldn’t be building nuclear weapons,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For peace, the basic thing to do is not to remove nuclear weapons but to remove the fear, anger and suspicion in us. If we reduce them, reconciliation is easy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He recalled the three-week reconciliation program he ran for Israelis and Palestinians at the Plum Village, a monastery he runs, in southern France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When they arrived, they wouldn’t talk to each other, let alone look at each other. It took three weeks to transform and heal themselves,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to reconciliation is “compassionate listening” according to Nhat Hanh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compassionate listening is to help the other side suffer less. If we realize that other people are the same people as we are, we are no longer angry at them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He advised politicians, especially, to learn the Buddhist way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re a politician, you might want to learn the Buddhist way of negotiation. Restoring communication and bringing back reconciliation is clear and concrete in Buddhism.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Miracles of Understanding&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace and reconciliation are possible if Thai citizens and politicians renew and apply engaged Buddhism in their lives and political activities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview with Zen master and Buddhist icon Thich Nhat Hanh was unique. He did not impart his message through words, but principally through his being and interaction with the interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/miracles-of-understanding.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We can conduct this interview as a meditation session. From time to time, we will listen to the bell, breathe and relax. We are in a Buddhist country, we have the right to do so,&amp;quot; the dhamma teacher chuckled. The interview took place at the Thai Plum Village Meditation Centre in Pak Chong, Nakhon Rachasima. We sat together in a small bamboo shack, surrounded by trees, a lotus pond and a backdrop of a mountain range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In Buddhist teaching, we practice breathing as a way to relax our body. We can calm our feelings and emotions. That way, we can do whatever we are doing in a peaceful and happy way. This is the practice of the dhamma,&amp;quot; he smiled, then added: &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s how we serve our country, in depth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the almost two-hour interview, the 87-year-old master did not show any signs of fatigue. He remained poised, relaxed. His voice was soft but clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We need to renew Buddhist tradition so that the teachings, the practice, fit modern times and continue to serve the country. And it is not only the work of the monastics, but of every citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Society is sick. Everyone is sick, including politicians. Journalists also suffer. The collective energy of the country is stifled by fear, anger, suspicion, and despair,&amp;quot; he observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his visit to Thailand last month under the theme &amp;quot;Together We Are One&amp;quot;, the noted peace activist monk seemed to pay particular attention to the political landscape. A day after his arrival, he delivered a talk on leadership and politics which was designed specifically for political and social leaders (even though only a few of those invited showed up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He delivered a dhamma talk to a 6,000-strong crowd at Paragon Hall and during our interview, he remained on the concerned topic: individuals, especially politicians, should practice mindful living and deep listening, produce loving speech and most of all, look deeply into the nature of suffering, individually and collectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what he meant by renewing Buddhism, or in other words &amp;quot;applied Buddhism&amp;quot;, which he believes to be key to helping Thai society reinstate peace and reconciliation; and to improve our political life and the way politics is conducted in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Buddhism is our heritage. To renew Buddhism is a way we can preserve peace and remove divisions. We can make people communicate to each other more easily. They can reconcile.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace is always possible and Buddhism has a substantial role to play through the simple practice of mindfulness, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, Thich Nhat Hanh and his international sangha of Plum Village in France have been providing retreats for mindful practice to many groups of people; police officers, politicians, war veterans from Vietnam and the Middle East, prison administrators, school teachers, scientists, families and couples as well as people in conflicts, such as the Palestinians and Israelis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these many retreats, Thich Nhat Hanh said there have been &amp;quot;miracles of understanding and reconciliation&amp;quot; among couples, family members and friends, even those who see one another as arch enemies. Thich Nhat Hanh arranged for Palestinians and Israelis to practice together. Initially, they practiced mindful breathing and walking and looking deeply into their own sufferings. Over the next few days, they practiced deep listening and giving &amp;quot;loving speech&amp;quot; to one another. All of these basic principles brought the conflicting sides to shrug off their hatred and embrace each other in a spirit of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our enemies are not human beings. They are cravings, anger, hatred, suspicion, despair,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;The energy of mindfulness is healing and helps us recognise that,&amp;quot; the monk explained. &amp;quot;When you suffer less, you are lighter. You are more compassionate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our society suffers from discrimination, &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;me&amp;quot;, he said. But suffering as well as joy is always collective, it is not individual. When each individual cultivates the energy of joy, peace and compassion, we will have an effect on those around us; family, friends and colleagues in an organisation or community. From a happy person, comes a happy family, a happy organisation and a happy society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the road to peace needs to begin from within, as the Zen master communicates through his famous calligraphic piece, Peace in oneself, peace in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Next time, we may organise a retreat for politicians and maybe for journalist too,&amp;quot; the monk smiled. To better serve the country, Thich Nhat Hanh advised politicians and political parties as well as citizens to embrace the spiritual dimension in their political activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, politicians have to learn how to heal themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Politicians suffer a lot. In them, there are fear, anger, stress, suspicion, cravings. They make themselves suffer, their families suffer, their parties also suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They need to come out of those negative energies in order to better serve the country.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not just words. Thich Nhat Hanh actually did offer a retreat to politicians and congressmen in Washington, DC. And it yielded satisfying results, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They&amp;#39;ve learned how to calm their emotions, to stop thinking and talking. Some of them practiced walking meditation. Some said they can survive the hectic and stressful environment; otherwise they would be burnt out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic principle of the retreat for politicians was similar to that which the master gives to any other groups. It begins with going back to oneself, to look and listen deeply to one&amp;#39;s own sufferings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The energy of mindfulness is healing. It helps us recognise sufferings, identify our roots of sufferings. And when you understand your own sufferings, compassion arises and freedom [from suffering] comes right away.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Buddhist perspective, understanding (wisdom) is a great power, said Thich Nhat Hanh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From understanding, our approaches and actions will not generate negative energies or outcomes that have already created suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddhist Zen master referred to the Sept 11 terrorist attacks when he gave dhamma talks in Berkeley, San Francisco, and New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;After the attack, there was a lot of anger and fear and the collective energy was very dangerous. So I proposed to the whole country to sit down and listen to sufferings in the country. There were people who felt they were subject to discrimination and brutality.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monk explained that we need to understand our own sufferings and roots of sufferings, for it leads us to understand the other party&amp;#39;s sufferings too. From such understanding, we are open to listen to the other party and the healing process, or peace process, can begin. Without such a process, and with a lot of fear, suspicion and anger, no peace talks or negotiation can be initiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But America did not listen to me. A few days later, they started war,&amp;quot; he looked down, followed by a pause of silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the obstacles towards reconciliation is our justified anger, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We feel we have the right to be angry. The other party feels the same. And there can&amp;#39;t be any reconciliation. We have to be able to say, &amp;#39;I am sorry&amp;#39;. Each party has to say that for, in fact, each of us is responsible and has done things that hurt others.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thai society can learn from the lesson of the US and do better, he said, to solve our political conflicts and violence. Thich Nhat Hanh suggested we Thais organise sessions to listen deeply and compassionately to the sufferings in the country and urged the whole country to meditate on the sufferings inside the conflicts, divisions and hatred, which is the foundation of violence and fear in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This applied Buddhism is the power that can help reinstate peace in society; not political power, economic power, money or fame. Those conventionally perceived as power only bring struggle, division, separation and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We belong to the same nation. It&amp;#39;s possible that we can work hand in hand. While we are serving the country as the government, we are at the same time serving the country as the opposition. We don&amp;#39;t need to fight and destroy the country.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for voters, we can help reduce politicians&amp;#39; sufferings and thus collective afflictions in society. Thich Nhat Hanh suggested: &amp;quot;Politicians have to tell us about their life, not their diploma and so on. If you run for parliament, you have to tell us whether you are happy in the family or not,&amp;quot; he chuckled. &amp;quot;If you are not happy in the family or in the party, if there is division and separation in your party, how can you make us happy and united as a country?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write in the middle of a monastic retreat with some 400 monastics - a lot of whom have made their way overland from Vietnam including some high Venerables. The picture below is from the &amp;quot;offering the rose ceremony&amp;quot; which took place this morning directly following our ‘formal lunch style’ breakfast together. The ceremony allowed 26 young Vietnamese aspirants to formally ask to be ordained as novice monks and nuns by Thay the ceremony for which will take place after this and a further Vietnamese speaking lay retreat to be held next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the hottest month of the year and midday much effort is made to stay cool in the shade. WE are in a rural part of Pak Chong district which lies some 3 hours drive north of the even hotter Bangkok. Colours are vivid here with terracotta red soil smattered with white rocks and strewn over with green plants. Then the green of the hills and vast blue skies. The locals somehow clear the heavy embedded for planting manioc and other crops. With the even deposition of heavy rocks and the flatness of the surrounding land it doesn’t take an expert to see the lands past life as an ocean bed. But experts have been here and are excited to find fossils in the rocks dating back 250 million years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every now and then rocky hills of jagged sharp rock, spikey plants and trees pop up randomly defying the flatness. On the western horizon you see the rain forested mountains of Khoa Yai – a world heritage national park and great towering cumuliform clouds billow up from the forest such that we witness the forest making weather and acting as our external lungs. The Plum Village Thailand monastic community relocated here only a week before Thay and the delegation arrived yet already they feel home here. Apart from the 3 identical and well designed cloister residences for the monks and nuns (built at a very reduced cost by a supporter)there is really everything is to do here. Having said that the plans are made and much is already underway. There is a walking meditation path and a groove nested inbetween some hills for the Sangha to enjoy sitting together in the cool mornings. There is a makeshift kitchen and the airy building you see in the picture makes do as a Dharma Hall but will become the dining hall for the whole monastery. The amount of water pumped from underground will have to be increased to meet the needs of the continuous big retreat programmes. Thays hut is underway and simsapa saplings border the site where a Meditation hall for up to 2000 will be constructed. Residences for lay practioners are needed. Altogether the estimate is 80 million Bact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1505&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;800&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/rose-ceremony-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Rose Ceremony in Thailand 2013[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we all are at the &amp;quot;New Land Monastery&amp;quot; - more aptly named than merely a reference to a new centre in Thailand since this monastery can be considered the new Bat Nha monastery. (Bat Nha being the Plum Village monastery of Vietnam and home for some 400 brothers and sisters by the time of Thays second visit to Vietnam in 2007 until the government forcibly expelled them all in September of 2009). The majority of the brothers and sisters took refuge in Thailand at this time constructing temporary dwellings and a palm leaf roofed Dharma Hall on land belonging to a most generous supporter – a former police officer. This was also in Pak Chong district. Now we have the New Land and permission to properly establish a monastery Thay shared “This is what we have waited for, conditions are good for us to live and practice together and fulfil our aspiration to serve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 2015/16 Winter Retreat Thay wishes for the whole international Plum Village monastic Sangha to gather here as took place in Deer park, 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

Are our politicians listening?[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Thais still politically poles apart and the conflict between supporters of the yellow and red shirts likely to intensify over proposed amendments to the Constitution, perhaps it is time to take heed of the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zen master suggests that mindful breathing, mindful walking and deep listening can help us reconcile everything from personal relationships to political conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the &amp;quot;Thich Nhat Hanh Public Talk: Together We are One&amp;quot; last Tuesday night at Siam Paragon&amp;#39;s Royal Paragon Hall, an event organised as part of month-long Thailand tour, the Zen master warned of the dangers of losing love in a consumer society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Many people think that the more they consume, the happier they&amp;#39;ll become,&amp;quot; says the 87-year-old, who looks 10 years younger than his age. &amp;quot;Yet we can observe that many of those who have of money and who have achieved fame still suffer a lot.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teacher and activist says he know many rich businessmen whose wives and children are not happy. &amp;quot;They are victims of their own success. Without love, we cannot be happy. If you are too busy making money, you have no love. After a day of hard work, you don&amp;#39;t have much to offer to your loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We need to ask ourselves &amp;#39;Do we have time to love and take care of the persons we care for?&amp;#39; A father who is always busy making money said to his son, &amp;#39;Tomorrow it&amp;#39;s your birthday, son. What do you want for your birthday? I will buy it for you&amp;#39;. The boy shrugged off the question then finally replied &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want anything. What I want is you&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh defines love as &amp;quot;being there for the persons you love&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The most precious gift you can give to your loves one is your presence. Make your presence fresh,&amp;quot; he stresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and love can be cultivated through mindfulness and if you know how to practice mindful breathing and walking, you can make your presence fresh, the Zen master explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddha teaches 16 exercises in mindful breathing. The third exercise is to be aware of your body. &amp;quot;Breathing in, I am aware that I have a body. Breathing out, I smile with compassion. When you sit in front of your computer, you forget that you have a body, so it&amp;#39;s a good time to practise the third and fourth exercises. The fourth exercise is to release tensions in your body. You can do these exercises wherever you are, even sitting in a car.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while walking from the car park to your office, you can practice mindful walking, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Buddha teaches us that we should enjoy our in-breaths. Every inhalation is joyful and nourishing and every exhalation can release tension. When you walk to the office, even if the path is short, you might like to practice mindful breathing and mindful walking.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While breathing in, take two steps and become aware of the touch of your feet on the floor, he advises. &amp;quot;And when you become aware of the meeting between feet and floor, you stop thinking. Mindful walking helps you enjoy every step. When you take the first step, say &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve arrived.&amp;quot; And when you take the second step, again say, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve arrived.&amp;quot; To arrive here is to arrive in the here and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Buddha teaches us that the past has gone and the future has not yet come. Real life is in the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;While breathing out,&amp;quot; he continues, &amp;quot;take three steps. This is because our out-breaths are normally longer than our in-breaths. When you take the first and second steps, say &amp;#39;I am home&amp;#39;. And when you take the third, say &amp;#39;I am already home&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your true home is in the here and now and you can get in touch with life.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cultivate calm and peace for the day or night ahead, Thich Nhat Hanh suggests couples or family members hold mindful sitting sessions. &amp;quot;A person who does not have calmness and peace cannot be happy,&amp;quot; he points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seventh mindfulness exercise is to be aware of painful emotions while the eighth exercise serves to calm them. &amp;quot;Painful emotions do not allow us to be peaceful therefore we have to know how to handle them,&amp;quot; says the Zen master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Anger, fear or suffering is a kind of energy. If you don&amp;#39;t know how to handle these, you lose the energy for giving. The eighth exercise aims to generate the energy of mindfulness and take care of your feelings and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;While breathing in, bring your mind back to your body. When the mind and body are together, you are at home and the energy of mindfulness makes you truly present in the here and now. And when you have enough energy of mindfulness and are aware of your feelings, you have enough peace and freshness to offer to those you love.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retreats at Plum Village communities have long offered ways to bring happiness to people as well as restore communication to couples who haven&amp;#39;t talked to each other in years. Participants learn about mindful breathing, mindful walking and deep listening. &amp;quot;When they know how to listen mindfully, they are able to reconcile,&amp;quot; says the monk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the national level, Thich Nhat Hanh says the opposition parties can practice deep listening to bring about reconciliation, adding that reconciliation has not been possible because they lack peace and calmness. Each politician, he stresses, must sit down calmly and look at the sufferings of his opposite numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We don&amp;#39;t need to be in power in order to serve the country. If opposition parties have enough calmness and peace, they will be able to produce projects to help the country.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party in power should also apply the same principles. &amp;quot;They can say, &amp;#39;We know you are suffering. We would like to listen to your nation-serving policies. We know you can save our countries from difficulties. We can combine insights of both parties to serve the country.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Thay, Dear Sangha, Dear Friends of Br Gerard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1350&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;240&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/gerard-300x201.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Gerard Jansen[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have some very sad and unexpected news to share with the wider community. Br. Gerard, from Upper Hamlet, passed away yesterday, 19th April, 2013. It seems his passing was peaceful while everyone was at a day of mindfulness at New hamlet. He is known to many lay friends particularly through his loving way to handle all the registration of guests at the office at Upper Hamlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerard has been resident in Plum Village for 6 or so years and will continue to be dearly loved and cherished by all the community of Plum Village. For the last few years Gerard has been based in Upper Hamlet where he worked wholeheartedly in the registration office offering his warmth and cheerfulness to everyone without exception. Gerard saw Plum Village as his home practicing deeply the Dharma seal of our tradition: I have arrived, I am home - Gerard often shared and demonstrated by his commitment that he saw clearly that Plum Village community was his spiritual home and family. He cultivated a contagious overflowing gratitude for life in Sangha. Apart from shorter interactions with guests through the registration office Gerard was always there for people taking time to listen at length and deeply with long and short term lay friends who sort his support. He shared his ever deepening insight with us through conversations and letters but again, perhaps most of all through his energetic and fatherly presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are someone who connected with Gerard we know this will be a difficult moment for you. Please take refuge in your Sangha as we are doing to embrace this sudden loss of our dear friend and brother on the path and to send him your and your Sangha&amp;#39;s love. Breathe peacefully, if with some sadness, knowing Gerard was a wonderful happy person and through his deep practice better equipped for such a dramatic untimely transition than many. Death comes unexpectedly, how can we bargain with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerard, still relatively young (mid fifties?), seemed in very good health. We are yet to learn the exact cause of death and will give more details as they come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contemplation on No-Coming, No-Going&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This body is not me.
I am not limited by this body.
I am life without boundaries.
I have never been born,
and I have never died.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the ocean and the sky filled with stars,
manifestations from my wondrous True Mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since before time, I have been free.
Birth and death are only doors through which we pass,
sacred thresholds on our journey.
Birth and death are a game of hide-and-seek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So laugh with me,
hold my hand,
let us say good-bye,
say good-bye, to meet again soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We meet today.
We will meet again tomorrow.
We will meet at the source every moment.
We meet each other in all forms of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay and the entire monastic retreat including high Venerables from Vietnam chanted and sent our energy of love and support this morning for Br Gerard in Pak Chong, Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In loving kindness and deep gratitude,&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;On behalf of Brothers of Upper hamlet and Son Ha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Public Talk in Bangkok&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;April 9, 2013. 116-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Paragon in Bangkok, Thailand. The sangha is on the spring Asian Tour and this talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into Thai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin with an introduction to listening to the chant by Thich Nhat Hanh. How do we have the capacity to listen that can lead to understanding? How can we get in touch with the suffering of the other person? We hear the monastics chant the name of Avalokiteshvara at 18-minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main talk begins at 38-minutes. When we hear the bell, we stop thinking and allow our body to relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme for the talk is how to suffer less, how to create happiness in our daily lives. What is happiness? Do we have time to love and take care of our beloved ones? Do I have the capacity to love? What can we offer those who we love? To love is to be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the Sutra on the Full Awarness of Mindful Breathing to cultivate love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking to arrive in the present. How should we walk? What other daily activities can we do with mindfulness? Can you see the many conditions of happiness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: the very end of the talk is cutoff in the recording. We apologize for this error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;A brush with enlightenment&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh demonstrates his art of meditation through calligraphy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1271&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;250&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/thay-writing-calligraphy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Thay is writing calligraphy - photo courtesy of bangkok post[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid an enthusiastic crowd at Bangkok Art and Culture Centre, the subject of attention remained poised and calm, heightening his audience&amp;#39;s attention, concentration and awareness as he prepared to begin his activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World-renowned Vietnamese Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh mixed tea with Chinese ink, picked up the brush and demonstrated his art of meditation through calligraphy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effortlessly, the 87-year-old master executed slow, steady strokes. His body was still, yet his hand flowed naturally, a conduit of his insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is it. Peace is possible. Breathe and smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short and simple, profound and powerful, phrases such as these have become Thich Nhat Hanh&amp;#39;s signature statements that encompass core Buddhist teachings and remind practitioners of mindful practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Writing calligraphy is a practice of meditation,&amp;quot; said the poet, writer and peace activist who is famous for his teachings on applied Buddhism in everyday life. &amp;quot;The way I do calligraphy, I do it in a certain way that can generate the energy of mindfulness, concentration, insight and compassion during the time of practice.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Held for the first time in Thailand, the exhibition &amp;quot;Calligraphic Meditation: The Mindful Art of Thich Nhat Hanh&amp;quot; presents the largest collection of the Zen master&amp;#39;s calligraphy to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When I begin to draw a circle, I will breathe in during the time I do the first half of the circle. When I do the second half of the circle, I breathe out,&amp;quot; said the master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;During the time I draw the circle, I realise too that this hand of mine contains the hands of my father, mother and ancestors. So my father, mother, ancestors and teachers are doing the circle with me. And since we are doing the circle together, there is no self, no separate self. So drawing a circle, you can get an insight of anatta or no-self.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is such power of meditation and insights that makes Thich Nhat Hanh&amp;#39;s calligraphic art distinctive and much sought-after across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts of Compassion&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;April 8, 2013. 116-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Mahachulalungkornrajavidyalaya University in Bangkok, Thailand. The sangha is in the 5-Day Applied Ethics Retreat as part of the spring Asian Tour. The talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into Thai. This is the final talk of the retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we apply the dharma into our daily lives? What is Applied Buddhism? In the last five years we have been trying to offer the teachings in non-Buddhist circles through classes in Europe and Hong Kong. We have now started to use the term Applied Ethics. This means translating Buddhism into a secular language. Today we will spend time on the teachings of Applied Ethics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay reads a question from one of the attendees about deep listening. The story of family in deep sadness and exists in silence but lives in the same house. Teaching on the Four Noble Truths. What is suffering? How can we live simply and build brotherhood and sisterhood? Practicing with Right View can relieve the suffering. What do we mean by right view?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birth and death. What are our ideas about birth and death? What is being and non-being? Illustrations of a cloud and a flower. Interbeing allows us to transcend these notions. Applied ethics is to apply more beauty, more solidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nirvana. Karma. Sangha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you have a thought of compassion or understanding, you should write it down.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Stepping into Freedom – Stepping into Joy&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;WakeUp Retreat in Jericho/ Palestine, April 7th – 9th 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ten.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our tour in Israel and Palestine led us five monastic brothers and sisters to a wonderful community called EcoMe, half an hour drive from Jerusalem, in the desert between the Dead Sea and Jericho. Here, in a “zone” where both Israelis and Palestinians feel comfortable, people from both nations meet regularly on the common ground of working, sharing and being together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wish of the Plum Village monastics was to offer as many tools as possible for developing the insight of Interbeing by the use of mindful breathing, sitting, eating, walking, deep listening and loving speech. Israelis, Palestinians and Internationals would have the opportunity to learn the skillful means to generate understanding and compassion in their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cactus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of them were very open and eager to know more about the “others”. At arrival day after a “warm-up Be In”, a collective meal and sitting meditation, conversations and sharings amongst the “not so different at all” young people started immediately and lasted joyfully into the time of “Noble Silence”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second day was fully packed with “practice”, and those who stayed up late the night before would feel it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made sandwiches at 6:30am and started Walking Meditation to have breakfast in a wadi. Walking through the amazing scenery in the absolute silence of the desert, we stopped twice to enjoy the stunning views and to listen to a Lakota chant one of our brothers offered into the stillness. The sun was doing its best. Luckily, 250m below sea level, in the absence of UV rays, sunburns are simply non-existent. Still, we were very happy to enjoy our meal in the shade of the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/donkey_people.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/chanting.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After regaining some energy, we practiced the 10 Mindful Movements, and enjoyed a Dharma Talk. Then we walked, happy and exhausted, back to EcoMe, where everybody sank into his/her sleeping bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A collective Mindful Meal, guided Deep Relaxation, Working Meditation and Consultations with the monastics followed our afternoon rest. Then we had Dharma Sharing, in which people shared their reflections and experience with the practice. Fears, hopes and needs as well as wishes for a common future of both nations were so honestly and intimately expressed that by the end we felt so “grown together”, so “One”, so “Family”. This afternoon was truly the peak of healing and transforming energy in this retreat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner was very welcomed, and although tired from this rich day, we gathered joyfully in the “meditation hall” to listen to a presentation on the Five Mindfulness Trainings, shared by five young people who had received them in Plum Village. Each spoke about the influence and benefit on their quality of life. There was no time for evening Sitting Meditation. We closed at 10 pm and nobody was able to keep their eyes open long enough to witness the “Noble Silence”. Holy Night, Silent Night.&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/eating.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we were so “One”. Sitting Meditation in the very morning was so powerful and the following Dharma Talk about inclusiveness and compassion (“You cannot be compassionate from 9:00 to 11:00, you are compassionate or you are not”), charmed and encouraged all of us to live and practice truthfully and wholeheartedly, to live Interbeing, kindling love and peace within ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended this extraordinary retreat literally “Stepping into Freedom, Stepping into Joy” with a never ending and joyful Be In. Everybody contributed songs, poems, stories, dances and so on, forgetting about the impermanence of time. Finally, after practicing countless Hugging Meditations, exchanging emails, smiles and tears, we scattered in the ten directions, carrying the sprouted seeds of love, peace and oneness in us home to share the fruits with all beings.
&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bein.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting here back in Plum Village and writing these lines, this feeling of connectedness arises again and I am so happy and grateful. I am looking forward to practicing with you again, here or there or anywhere. Thank you all for being who you are. I am in you and you are in me.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;How Do We Practice?&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;April 7, 2013. 86-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Mahachulalungkornrajavidyalaya University in Bangkok, Thailand. The sangha is in the 5-Day Applied Ethics Retreat as part of the spring Asian Tour. The talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into Thai. Today is a session of questions and answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When practicing deep listening and the other person uses words that hurt themselves and others then what should we do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I use skillful means and loving speech when the other person uses derogatory  speech in regards to women and people of color.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the hill tribes, they need to kill animals and cut the trees in order to survive. How to help transform their way of life that isn’t so harmful?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to work with schools that have rules and don’t allow applying mindfulness into the school environment?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I practice when there is suffering in my life, in my students lives, and in my parents lives?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I practice, something happens for transformation but it doesn’t always stay and I feel discouraged. How can I keep the transformation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Living in a busy city it’s challenging to apply the mindfulness practices we learn here. Can you help?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we practice reconciliation for children who have been abused by their parents?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session concludes with an explanation of the Five Mindfulness Trainings.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;April 6, 2013. 92-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Mahachulalungkornrajavidyalaya University in Bangkok, Thailand. The sangha is in the 5-Day Applied Ethics Retreat as part of the spring Asian Tour. The talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into Thai. This is the second talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inviting the bell. The bell is the ambassador of the buddha to our home. How do we use the bell in our home? How do we listen to the bell? We can use the sound to calm our feelings. Using a breathing room along with the bell in your home environment. Listening and using the bell has been of great help to many families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Henry and his transformation of using mindfulness in the classroom. How he enjoys his class and his students. The whole school benefited from his incorporation of mindfulness. He wrote a book and became a dharma teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we help the students suffer less? Compassionate listening and loving speech. Transform our classroom into a family, into a sangha. No Buddhist terms are needed. Then you can build a sangha of teachers. Using loving speech is a tool for teachers. How do we listen?&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Happy Teachers will Change the World&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;April 5, 2013. 120-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Mahachulalungkornrajavidyalaya University in Bangkok, Thailand. The sangha is in the 5-Day Applied Ethics Retreat as part of the spring Asian Tour. The talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into Thai. This is the first talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddha was a happy teacher and that’s how he was able to help others. If we are not happy teachers then it will be difficult to help out students. How can we offer happiness? Do you have happiness to offer? Do you have happiness and love in yourself? What is the best thing we can offer a person we love? The first mantra is “Darling, I am here for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That shares about people meditation and how the sangha has used it for teaching children about the practice. Flower | Fresh. Mountain | Solid. Water | Reflecting. Space | Freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice of Buddhism can be seen in two aspects. First, we learn how to suffer. If you know how to suffer then you suffer much less by making good use of your suffering. Happiness is made of non-happiness elements. Suffering is a non-happiness element.  The second aspect of the practice is learning how to create moments of happiness. With this we can transform our anger and fear. A good school teacher should know how to take care of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers taking care of themselves and is comprised of five elements (Skandhas): Body. Feelings. Perceptions. Mental formations. Consciousness.  We can learn to improve the quality of these five elements. How do we do this?  We begin with the body and the feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A school teacher can then create a moment of happiness for her students. How we can identify and cultivate moments of happiness for our students? How can we help the young person who is suffering?&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Orientation for Applied Ethics Retreat&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;April 4, 2013. 116-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh, Brother Phap Dung, and Sr. Tue Nghiem from Mahachulalungkornrajavidyalaya University in Bangkok, Thailand. The sangha is in the 5-Day Applied Ethics Retreat as part of the spring Asian Tour. The talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into Thai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin with an introduction to listening to the chant by Thich Nhat Hanh. How do we move from mindfulness of suffering to mindfulness of compassion leading to our transformation and healing? We hear the monastics chant the name of Avalokiteshvara at 14-minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main talk by Thich Nhat Hanh begins at 36-minutes. Happy teachers will change the world. What to do when we hear the bell? How will it help our breathing? Being established on the present moment. Gives us the power to heal. What is walking meditation? Why do we practice walking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning at 60-minutes two monastics, Brother Phap Dung and Sister Tue Nghiem, teach about the breathing practice, sitting practice, eating practice, and noble silence practice.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Spring Updates&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Hello listening community. We have been relatively quiet here on the archive the past weeks and I want to provide an update. Following the Winter Retreat, our Teacher held a Monastic Retreat and a French Retreat. The monastic retreat is for the monastics only and the French retreat teachings were given in French and I have been unable to secure an English translation for the archive. If one becomes available, it will be posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, our Teacher and monastics of Plum Village have traveled to Thailand to begin the two month &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/events/view/33/4.html&quot;&gt;Asia Tour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; where they will teach in Thailand, South Korea and Hong Kong. In all likelihood, these teachings will be given in English with simultaneous translation into Thai, Korean, and Mandarin (respectively). I will be making every effort to provide these teachings as they become available. The first event begins on April 4 in Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lotus for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Create a Moment of Happiness&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;March 10, 2013. 45-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Upper Hamlet at Plum Village during the Daffodil Festival. We have been quiet here on the archive because the sangha took time for lazy days as well as a monastic retreat (not distributed). This talk is given in English and the sangha is preparing for the arrival of 600 French in the coming week. A few suggested subjects for the retreat include: happiness is possible, healing is possible how to live more deeply, coming home, do not wander anymore, and go as a river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice of Plum Village can be seen in two points. First, how to recognize the suffering and embrace it and transform it. We cannot avoid suffering. If you know how to suffer, you will suffer less. The art of suffering. We have blocks of suffering, but how to handle the little sufferings? How do we support those attending the retreat? How do we prepare the space so they know that healing is possible with every step and every breath? There is no way to healing, healing is the way. In order to heal, we have to stop. The Five Mindfulness Trainings can help us with this practice. They have the power to heal. It is possible to create moments of happiness in our daily lives. Learn how to enjoy and savor the little happinesses in life. Can you create a moment of happiness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we do about the mental discourse in our head? Radio NST (Non-Stop-Thinking). One practice is to feel our body and our feelings. We can practice walking meditation. It is an opportunity to create moments of happiness and to heal. Eating in mindfulness is another practice. Being aware of the food and members of the sangha around you. This is not hard labor. The dharma is lovely and every minute of the practice can be healing and transforming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Available here as a audio download or a video.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Keeping the Essential Teaching of Buddhism&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;February 3, 2013. 91-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Upper Hamlet at Plum Village. The sangha is in the 90-day Rains Retreat (Winter Retreat). This is the twenty-sixth dharma talk of the retreat with the theme &lt;em&gt;Are You The Soulmate of the Buddha?&lt;/em&gt; The talk is given in Vietnamese and this is a translation provided by Sr. Chan Không. It is the final talk of the winter retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we the soulmate of the Buddha? We are asking if we are making any mistakes about the teaching. Are we misunderstanding the Buddha? We’ve learned about dualistic thinking. And we’ve learned about the unnecessary questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we practice with the Dharma body? The teaching? Everyone can practice like the Buddha. Everyone can be enlightened. It is not a religion. The teaching of the Buddha non-dualistic. Even right from the beginning Buddhism split into two schools. The misperception started right from the beginning. Again, what is being the soulmate of the Buddha? How do we keep the essential teaching and also the delusion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if we diefy the Buddha, then what happens? We can get lost in the idea of self. Discovering the middle way. Sometimes we need to dilute Buddhism a little without forgetting the essential teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signlessness. Seeing the Buddha in others and other things. The Buddha is next to you. Open your eyes. The Buddha is still there if we practice signlessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your self is transforming every day.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Universal Monarch&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;January 31, 2013. 83-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Lower Hamlet at Plum Village. The sangha is in the 90-day Rains Retreat (Winter Retreat). This is the twenty-fifth dharma talk of the retreat with the theme &lt;em&gt;Are You The Soulmate of the Buddha?&lt;/em&gt; The talk is given in Vietnamese and this is a translation provided by Sr. Chan Không.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin with an outline of the next few weeks at Plum Village. Following the winter retreat, the sangha will celebrate the lunar new year for four days. After the lunar new year, there will be a monastic retreat which concludes with a monastic lamp transmission ceremony in which our lay friends are welcome to attend. During the monastic retreat, all monastics will stay at Upper Hamlet and our lay friends will stay at other hamlets. We are fortunate to have the monastics from Germany and Paris join us for the monastic retreat. The lamp transmission ceremony will take place on February 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week we learned the sutra on the white clad disciple. We should practice the five trainings and the four recollection To be on the path of enlightenment. There is also something called the five powers. This is very helpful for the businessman or the politician. The first power is faith. The others are diligence, mindfulness, concentration, and Generosity. Thay talks about sutra called the Universal Ruler or Monarch and the seven treasures. Ruling with the Dharma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of a couple of kings is shared. King Ashoka. King Milanda. Kanishka. We also listen to the transition from tribal society to Monarch society to democracy. Polytheism and monotheism. We conclude with the story from the Sutra Agama #2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_april-21-28-2013-upper-hamlet-lower-hamlet-plum-village-_&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;April 21-28, 2013 - &lt;strong&gt;Upper Hamlet &amp;amp; Lower Hamlet - Plum Village&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.plumvillage.org/images/stories/events/Di_bo_len_nha_tho.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Di_bo_len_nha_tho&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will practice with our body to awaken our mind. Revitalizing body through physical exercises focused on breath and life force: walking, mindful movements, qi gong, tai chi, stick exercises…
Let us learn to increase our physical and mental energy by accessing our hidden but actually inexhaustible energy reserves in body and mind through the practice of relaxation and the joy of living happily in the present moment, as we benefit from the collective energy of the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We modify our eating habits, taking only light meals to maximize the process of detoxification, to better nourish our brain and to remain clear and awake in every situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we widen our circle, discovering loving and effective ways of assisting and accompanying persons who are aged, disabled or in great physical or mental suffering including serious depression, incurable illnesses, cancer or trauma. All is based on the Buddhist teachings as renewed and applied to our own time by Plum Village, as well as other traditions such as acupuncture, shiatsu, moxa, massage, Chinese herbal medicine, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retreat is in Plum Village, where we can benefit from the daily monastic practices such as sitting meditation, walking meditation, meals together in silence, sharing our experiences in small groups, relaxation, touching the Earth, noble silence, and reciting the Buddhist mindfulness trainings. The retreat will be supported by the entire community of monastic and lay residents, numerous Dharma teachers of Plum Village, and health professionals (doctors, therapists, traditional healers, caregivers and companions…).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to seeing you soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration form will be available soon*&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Summer Opening 2013&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;You are warmly invited to visit Plum Village and practice with our growing international community of practice and to enjoy the wonderful energy of mindfulness. The Summer Retreat is for us to enjoy simple and peaceful living, and thereby nurture our own inner growth.  We take time to look deeply in order to transform both our individual difficulties and the difficulties in our society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our practice at Plum Village helps us weave mindfulness into all of our daily activities. In this way we can practice meditation throughout the day, while eating, walking, working mindfully, sitting in meditation, or enjoying a cup of tea together. All visitors participate in communal activities such as arranging the meditation halls, preparing meals, cleaning bathrooms, emptying garbage, watering plants, washing pots, cleaning the kitchen and other tasks as part of the daily practice of mindfulness.  At Plum Village we emphasize community practice – so that we can support each other, and learn to live in together in harmony.  We ask everyone to contribute to the collective energy of practice by joining in all the scheduled activities. Guests are requested to refrain from smoking, drinking, and sexual practice during their stay; this supports everyone’s practice, lay and monastic. Once a week, there will be an opportunity to receive the five Mindfulness Trainings. The Trainings are the foundation of the Plum Village community, bringing happiness and meaning to all that we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In order to deepen your practice and make mindful living a vital part of your daily life, we request you stay a minimum of one week&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;With new blossoms on the way, and spectacular changing weather, spring-time offers us a wonderful opportunity to celebrate this beautiful season of transformation and renewal. We warmly welcome you to join our community of practice for a one week or two week retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be open to receive guests starting &lt;strong&gt;Friday, March 15th&lt;/strong&gt; and will continue to receive guests each week on Fridays. Friday will also be our departure day. &lt;strong&gt;Please plan your retreat carefully so that you can arrive and depart on Friday.&lt;/strong&gt; Also, plan your retreat well in advance so that you will have enough time to register and receive a confirmation (few weeks in advance is usually enough time). We will begin accepting registrations on &lt;strong&gt;December 2013. &lt;/strong&gt;The last arrival day for the Spring Retreat will be &lt;strong&gt;May 17th.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plumvillage.org/visiting-us/general-retreat-information.html&quot;&gt;General Retreat Information&lt;/a&gt; page and Registration pages carefully before sending any inquiries abou the Spring Retreat.

			&lt;h2 id=&quot;-&quot;&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy to announce the annual 7 day retreat for French speakers which will take place from Friday 15th to 22nd May, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this week long retreat, Thay (Venerable Thich Nhat Hanh) will offer a series of four talks including a Question and Answer session all in French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Dharma talks by Thay, activities will include sitting meditation and chanting, walking meditation, circle sharing (family groups of approx. 25), total relaxation and Qi Gong stick exercises. There will be a presentation of the Five Mindfulness Trainings and the practice of Beginning Anew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a wonderful opportunity for French-speaking practitioners to come together for a joyous celebration of the Dharma to build the French Sangha and to hear Thay offering his profound teachings directly in French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation into English and other languages will be available for Thay&amp;#39;s talks as required and other activities where possible. There will be an English-speaking family to join so that non-French speakers can also participate in Dharma Sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration please visit&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Apple Harvest  &lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/applepicking1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;About a week ago someone told us that our annual tradition of apple picking was coming around once again.  There are some orchards nearby that are harvested a couple times over the course of the autumn. Whatever can’t be gathered by the mechanized pickers is left for any enthusiastic locals with a taste for apples.  We definitely qualified!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bikkhu Sangha stayed back in Plum Village to observe the monastery boundaries for the Winter Retreat. The novices and lay friends were free to pick apples and enjoy the crisp, morning air. There was a bit of dissent in our car ride, protests were made against a few passing rain clouds, but in the end the sun came out and apples were enjoyed by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/applepicking21.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;Picking was a pretty joyful endeavor, and turned out to be a bit absurd as well.  Most of the apples were isolated and out of reach. The Plum Village pack mentality kept us together, and the result was small groups of people moving around with a ladder, setting it up, picking one apple, and then moving on. We weren’t going to win any productivity awards but smiles were in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay joined us for the morning and proved to be a devoted picker. All apples within reach were plucked with care and placed in our crate. More difficult prospects were dislodged with an umbrella and caught by one of the attendants. We wandered from row to row as Thay checked in with the brothers and sisters. Is everyone having a good time? I think we were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/applepicking3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;After an hour or so it seemed that our objective was not so much to supply the Sangha with apples, but more to supply ourselves with enough apples for a picnic.  We sat between two rows of trees and enjoyed slices of apple sandwiched by a couple of crackers.  Brothers and sisters came by, joined us for a snack, and continued with the harvest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before the end of our picnic he delivered the landmark teaching, “Present moment, apple moment.”  It may not make it into the next calligraphy exhibition, but it was certainly relevant at the time.  The morning with Thay left me feeling light and peaceful, and chock full of apples. In the afternoon, I just napped. ~Troi Bieu Hien&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REVIEWS&lt;/strong&gt;
“Practical, wise, and deeply compassionate, Work offers us a path for discovering the joy and inspiration that lies at the very heart of our household, livelihood, and daily routines.” â€”Michael Carroll, author of Awake at Work and The Mindful Leader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Work is a practical handbook for those who seek sanity and serenity at work. I love the beautiful simplicity of his teachings and the clarity they produce in my mind.” ~BJ Gallager, coauthor of Being Buddha at Work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thich Nhat Hanh has invited the world into mindfulness for generations. His latest gift is a call to return to the moment at work and throughout the day. Work gives us an opening into the happiness available in the here and now. Others may lecture, others may advise; Thich Nhat Hanh invites. I am grateful; you will be as well.” ~Franz Metcalf, author of What Would Buddha Do?&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Leaves are Falling and the Wind is Blowing&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In the last week of September, twenty-two monks piled into vans for a trip to the Spanish Pyrenees. We had just gotten back from the public talk in Paris, and for a lot of people this was going to be the first real break since May. Thay Phap Luu used to live in a mountain village over there, so he knew enough about the area to plan a pretty kickin trip. After five hours of driving, we unpacked our gear at the mountain refuge of Bujaruelo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/pluu-150x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
This whole chunk of Los Pireneos is a national park, some of it listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site, and indeed if it weren’t for the roads, trails, and high-tension power lines, we could have imagined ourselves crossing these mountains in the days of yore. Well, also there were the cows. I guess when they made the area a park, they added the stipulation that ganaderos would always be able to drive their cattle up the hills to graze. Every morning we’d wake up to the cows and their cowbells “going ding-dang-dong” all over the hillside, as Dai Tue put it. We found them to be docile if not affectionate friends on the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hiked for four days and the weather was mostly cooperative. A few nights it rained, which made the local people happy and charged the streams and waterfalls, making us happy in turn. The area is known for beautiful cascades, but the dry summer left most of them dusty beds until our first night in town. We got lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/img_9344_final-150x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;Two of the days we spent in the low valleys, plodding up in a group that couldn’t quite keep form. Not everyone had real shoes for hiking, and some people enjoyed a more vigorous pace. Then there were all the brothers who insisted on bringing large quantities of hot water along so that we’d be able to have a tea party. My Pacific Northwest hiking background tells me this is nonsense, but I wasn’t complaining when I had a cup of oolong in the beautiful Ordesa Valley. Monks will be monks after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third day yawned with morning rain, and most of the brothers opted to stay in. Nine heroes set forth for to visit Thay Phap Luu’s old abode, a beautiful old village that’s been abandoned for almost one hundred years. As the clouds dissolved, we saw that the mountains had been dusted with the first snow of the season. There are a few people still living up in that village, and we broke bread with one of them. A gracious host and skilled gardener, Pepe treated us like royalty. He and Phap Luu had met briefly in the late nineties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth day was most ambitious. We’d cross over to the French side, then climb to a refuge just below the Breche de Roland, a beautiful, open door between the French and Spanish Pyrenees. Legend has it that Roland smashed it open with his sword while fending off the Moors. We were to climb the 1500 meters with mostly tennis shoes. This was tricky hiking over the ice and snow. Passers by, we noted, were equipped with poles, cleated shoes, ice picks, and Lord knows what else in their fancy backpacks. Most of the brothers were content to rest in the refuge when we arrived, but six or seven of us pressed on to the Breche, and we were rewarded with a spectacular view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finished up the trip with a meandering return that took us through Pamplona, San Sebastian, and included a much needed stop at some natural hot springs. Now we’re back and swinging into gear for the Autumn retreat. Leaves are falling and the wind is blowing. The big annual monastic move is coming up, which is where we all shuffle rooms. Change is happening, people!&lt;/p&gt;

wide enough to embrace what&amp;#39;s inside

			&lt;h1&gt;Oprah Talks to Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He&amp;#39;s been a Buddhist monk for more than 60 years, as well as a teacher, writer, and vocal opponent of war—a stance that left him exiled from his native Vietnam for four decades. Now the man Martin Luther King Jr. called &amp;quot;an apostle of peace and nonviolence&amp;quot; reflects on the beauty of the present moment, being grateful for every breath, and the freedom and happiness to be found in a simple cup of tea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/201003-omag-oprah-thich-nhat-hanh.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;The moment I meet Thich Nhat Hanh at the Four Seasons Hotel in Manhattan, I feel his sense of calm. A deeply tranquil presence seems to surround the Zen Buddhist master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But beneath Nhat Hanh&amp;#39;s serene demeanor is a courageous warrior. The 83-year-old native of Vietnam, who joined the monastery when he was 16, valiantly opposed his own government during the Vietnam War. Even as he embraced the contemplative life of a monk, the war confronted him with a choice: Should he remain hidden away in the monastery tending to matters of the spirit, or go out and help the villagers who were suffering? Nhat Hanh&amp;#39;s decision to do both is what gave birth to &amp;quot;Engaged Buddhism&amp;quot;—a movement that involves peaceful activism for the purpose of social reform. It&amp;#39;s also what led Martin Luther King Jr. to nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize in 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of his denunciation of the violence inflicted on his countrymen, Nhat Hanh founded a relief organization that rebuilt bombed Vietnamese villages, set up schools and medical centers, and resettled homeless families. Nhat Hanh also created a Buddhist university, a publishing house, and a peace activist magazine—all of which led the Vietnamese government to forbid him, in 1966, to return home after he&amp;#39;d left the country on a peace mission. He remained in exile for 39 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before his exile, Nhat Hanh had spent time in the West (studying at Princeton and teaching at Columbia University in the early 1960s), and it was to the West that he now returned. Seeing an opportunity to spread Buddhist thought and encourage peaceful activism, he led the Buddhist Peace Delegation to the Paris Peace Talks in 1969, established the Unified Buddhist Church in France, and went on to write more than 100 books, including the 1995 best-seller Living Buddha, Living Christ—a volume that never leaves my nightstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh eventually settled in Southern France and founded Plum Village, the Buddhist meditation practice center and monastery where he still lives. Thousands of people travel there each year to join him in exploring the tenets of Buddhism—including mindfulness (intentionally tuning in to the present moment), the development of a practice (a regular activity, such as mindful walking, that redirects you toward right thinking), and enlightenment (the liberation from suffering that comes when you wake up to the true nature of reality). These principles were introduced to the world more than 2,000 years ago by Siddhartha Gautama, or the Buddha, the Indian-born prince who left a life of ease and indulgence in order to seek enlightenment—and founded a religion along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh—or, as his students call him, Thây, the Vietnamese word for &amp;quot;teacher&amp;quot;—brings along a group of Plum Village monks and nuns to listen in on our conversation. In some spiritual traditions, there is a concept called &amp;quot;holding the space&amp;quot;—or showing up as a compassionate listener. Thây&amp;#39;s friends are the space holders who have traveled with him from France, and as we take a photograph together just before our chat, they usher in a peaceful mood by collectively singing a Buddhist song: &amp;quot;We are all the leaves of one tree; we are all the waves of one sea; the time has come for all to live as one.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Thank you for the honor of talking to you. Just being in your presence, I feel less stressed than when the day started. You have such a peaceful aura. Are you always this content?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: This is my training, this is my practice. And I try to live every moment like that, to keep the peace in myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Because you can&amp;#39;t give it to others if you don&amp;#39;t have it in yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: I see. I know that you were born in Vietnam in 1926. Is there any wonderful memory of your childhood that you can share?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: The day I saw a picture of the Buddha in a magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: How old were you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: I was 7, 8. He was sitting on the grass, very peaceful, smiling. I was impressed. Around me, people were not like that, so I had the desire to be like him. And I nourished that desire until the age of 16, when I had the permission of my parents to go and ordain as a monk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Did your parents encourage you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: In the beginning, they were reluctant because they thought that the life of a monk is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: At 16, did you understand what the life would be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Not a lot. There was only the very strong desire. The feeling that I would not be happy if I could not become a monk. They call it the beginner&amp;#39;s mind—the deep intention, the deepest desire that a person may have. And I can say that until this day, this beginner&amp;#39;s mind is still alive in me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: That&amp;#39;s what a lot of people refer to as passion. It&amp;#39;s the way I feel about my work most days. When you&amp;#39;re passionate about your work, it feels like you would do it even if no one were paying you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: And you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: You enjoy it. Let&amp;#39;s talk about when you first arrived in America. You were a student at Princeton. Was it challenging as a Buddhist monk to form friendships with other students? Were you lonely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Well, Princeton University was like a monastery. There were only male students at that time. And there were not many Vietnamese living in the United States. During the first six months, I did not speak Vietnamese. But the campus was very beautiful. And everything was new—the trees and the birds and the food. My first snow was in Princeton, and the first time I used a radiator. The first fall was in Princeton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: When the leaves are changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: In Vietnam we did not see things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: At the time, were you wearing your monk robes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Never have to worry about buying clothes, do you? Always just the robe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Do you have different robes for different occasions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: You have a ceremonial robe, saffron color. That&amp;#39;s all. I feel comfortable wearing this kind of robe. And it happily reminds us that we are monks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: What does it mean to be a monk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: To be a monk is to have time to practice for your transformation and healing. And after that to help with the transformation and healing of other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Are most monks enlightened, or seeking enlightenment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Enlightenment is always there. Small enlightenment will bring great enlightenment. If you breathe in and are aware that you are alive—that you can touch the miracle of being alive—then that is a kind of enlightenment. Many people are alive but don&amp;#39;t touch the miracle of being alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: I&amp;#39;m sure you see all around you—I&amp;#39;m guilty of it myself—that we&amp;#39;re just trying to get through the next thing. In our country, people are so busy. Even the children are busy. I get the impression very few of us are doing what you just said—touching the miracle that you are alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: That is the environment people live in. But with a practice, we can always remain alive in the present moment. With mindfulness, you can establish yourself in the present in order to touch the wonders of life that are available in that moment. It is possible to live happily in the here and the now. So many conditions of happiness are available—more than enough for you to be happy right now. You don&amp;#39;t have to run into the future in order to get more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: What is happiness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Happiness is the cessation of suffering. Well-being. For instance, when I practice this exercise of breathing in, I&amp;#39;m aware of my eyes; breathing out, I smile to my eyes and realize that they are still in good condition. There is a paradise of form and colors in the world. And because you have eyes still in good condition, you can get in touch with the paradise. So when I become aware of my eyes, I touch one of the conditions of happiness. And when I touch it, happiness comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: And you could do that with every part of your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes. Breathing in, I am aware of my heart. Breathing out, I smile to my heart and know that my heart still functions normally. I feel grateful for my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: So it&amp;#39;s about being aware of and grateful for what we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: And not just the material things, but the fact that we have our breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes. You need the practice of mindfulness to bring your mind back to the body and establish yourself in the moment. If you are fully present, you need only make a step or take a breath in order to enter the kingdom of God. And once you have the kingdom, you don&amp;#39;t need to run after objects of your craving, like power, fame, sensual pleasure, and so on. Peace is possible. Happiness is possible. And this practice is simple enough for everyone to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Tell me how we do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Suppose you are drinking a cup of tea. When you hold your cup, you may like to breathe in, to bring your mind back to your body, and you become fully present. And when you are truly there, something else is also there—life, represented by the cup of tea. In that moment you are real, and the cup of tea is real. You are not lost in the past, in the future, in your projects, in your worries. You are free from all of these afflictions. And in that state of being free, you enjoy your tea. That is the moment of happiness, and of peace. When you brush your teeth, you may have just two minutes, but according to this practice, it is possible to produce freedom and joy during that time, because you are established in the here and now. If you are capable of brushing your teeth in mindfulness, then you will be able to enjoy the time when you take a shower, cook your breakfast, sip your tea.
Oprah: So from this point of view, there are endless conditions of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes. Mindfulness helps you go home to the present. And every time you go there and recognize a condition of happiness that you have, happiness comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: With you, the tea is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: I am real, and the tea is real. I am in the present. I don&amp;#39;t think of the past. I don&amp;#39;t think of the future. There is a real encounter between me and the tea, and peace, happiness and joy are possible during the time I drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: I never had that much thought about a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: We have the practice of tea meditation. We sit down, enjoy a cup of tea and our brotherhood, sisterhood. It takes one hour to just enjoy a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: A cup of tea, like this? [Holds up her cup.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: One hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Every moment is a moment of happiness. And during the hour of tea meditation, you cultivate joy, brotherhood, sisterhood, dwelling in the here and the now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Do you do the same thing with all food?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes. We have silent meals eaten in such a way that we get in touch with the cosmos, with every morsel of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: How long does it take you to get through a meal? All day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: One hour is enough. We sit as a community, and enjoy our meal together. So whether you are eating, drinking your tea, or doing your dishes, you do it in such a way that freedom, joy, happiness are possible. Many people come to our center and learn this art of mindful living. And go back to their hometowns and set up a sangha, a community, to do the same. We have helped set up sanghas all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: A sangha is a beloved community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: How important is that in our lives? People have it with their own families, and then you expand your beloved community to include others. So the larger your beloved community, the more you can accomplish in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: On the subject of community, let&amp;#39;s go back to 1966. You were invited to come and speak at Cornell University, and shortly after that, you weren&amp;#39;t allowed back into your country. You were exiled for 39 years. How did you deal with those feelings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Well, I was like a bee taken out of the beehive. But because I was carrying the beloved community in my heart, I sought elements of the sangha around me in America and in Europe. And I began to build a community working for peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Did you feel angry at first? Hurt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Angry, worried, sad, hurt. The practice of mindfulness helped me recognize that. In the first year, I dreamed almost every night of going home. I was climbing a beautiful hill, very green, very happily, and suddenly I woke up and found that I was in exile. So my practice was to get in touch with the trees, the birds, the flowers, the children, the people in the West—and make them my community. And because of that practice, I found home outside of home. One year later, the dreams stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: What was the reason you weren&amp;#39;t allowed back in the country?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: During the war, the warring parties all declared that they wanted to fight until the end. And those of us who tried to speak about reconciliation between brothers and brothers—they didn&amp;#39;t allow us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: So when you were a man without a country, you made a home in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: And the United States was one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: How did you meet Martin Luther King?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: In June 1965, I wrote him a letter explaining why the monks in Vietnam immolated themselves. I said that this is not a suicide. I said that in situations like the one in Vietnam, to make your voice heard is difficult. Sometimes we have to burn ourselves in order to be heard. It is out of compassion that you do that. It is the act of love and not of despair. And exactly one year after I wrote that letter, I met him in Chicago. We had a discussion about peace, freedom, and community. And we agreed that without a community, we cannot go very far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: How long was the discussion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Probably five minutes or so. And after that, there was a press conference, and he came out very strongly against the war in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Do you think that was a result of your conversation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: I believe so. We continued our work, and the last time I met him was in Geneva during the peace conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Did the two of you speak then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes. He invited me up for breakfast, to talk about these issues again. I got caught in a press conference downstairs and came late, but he kept the breakfast warm for me. And I told him that the people in Vietnam call him a bodhisattva—enlightened being—because of what he was doing for his people, his country, and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: And the fact that he was doing it nonviolently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes. That is the work of a bodhisattva, a buddha, always with compassion and nonviolence. When I heard of his assassination, I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it. I thought, &amp;quot;The American people have produced King but are not capable of preserving him.&amp;quot; I was a little bit angry. I did not eat, I did not sleep. But my determination to continue building the beloved community continues always. And I think that I felt his support always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Okay. We&amp;#39;ve been talking about mindfulness, and you&amp;#39;ve mentioned mindful walking. How does that work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: As you walk, you touch the ground mindfully, and every step can bring you solidity and joy and freedom. Freedom from your regret concerning the past, and freedom from your fear about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Most people when they&amp;#39;re walking are thinking about where they have to go and what they have to do. But you would say that removes us from happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: People sacrifice the present for the future. But life is available only in the present. That is why we should walk in such a way that every step can bring us to the here and the now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: What if my bills need to be paid? I&amp;#39;m walking, but I&amp;#39;m thinking about the bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: There is a time for everything. There is a time when I sit down, I concentrate myself on the problem of my bills, but I would not worry before that. One thing at a time. We practice mindful walking in order to heal ourselves, because walking like that really relieves our worries, the pressure, the tension in our body and in our mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: The case is the same for deep listening, which I&amp;#39;ve heard you refer to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Deep listening is the kind of listening that can help relieve the suffering of another person. You can call it compassionate listening. You listen with only one purpose: to help him or her to empty his heart. Even if he says things that are full of wrong perceptions, full of bitterness, you are still capable of continuing to listen with compassion. Because you know that listening like that, you give that person a chance to suffer less. If you want to help him to correct his perception, you wait for another time. For now, you don&amp;#39;t interrupt. You don&amp;#39;t argue. If you do, he loses his chance. You just listen with compassion and help him to suffer less. One hour like that can bring transformation and healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: I love this idea of deep listening, because often when someone comes to you and wants to vent, it&amp;#39;s so tempting to start giving advice. But if you allow the person just to let the feelings out, and then at another time come back with advice or comments, that person would experience a deeper healing. That&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes. Deep listening helps us to recognize the existence of wrong perceptions in the other person and wrong perceptions in us. The other person has wrong perceptions about himself and about us. And we have wrong perceptions about ourselves and the other person. And that is the foundation for violence and conflict and war. The terrorists, they have the wrong perception. They believe that the other group is trying to destroy them as a religion, as a civilization. So they want to abolish us, to kill us before we can kill them. And the antiterrorist may think very much the same way—that these are terrorists and they are trying to eliminate us, so we have to eliminate them first. Both sides are motivated by fear, by anger, and by wrong perception. But wrong perceptions cannot be removed by guns and bombs. They should be removed by deep listening, compassionate listening, and loving space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: The only way to end war is communication between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes. We should be able to say this: &amp;quot;Dear friends, dear people, I know that you suffer. I have not understood enough of your difficulties and suffering. It&amp;#39;s not our intention to make you suffer more. It is the opposite. We don&amp;#39;t want you to suffer. But we don&amp;#39;t know what to do and we might do the wrong thing if you don&amp;#39;t help us to understand. So please tell us about your difficulties. I&amp;#39;m eager to learn, to understand.&amp;quot; We have to have loving speech. And if we are honest, if we are true, they will open their hearts. Then we practice compassionate listening, and we can learn so much about our own perception and their perception. Only after that can we help remove wrong perception. That is the best way, the only way, to remove terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: But what you&amp;#39;re saying also applies to difficulties between yourself and family members or friends. The principle is the same, no matter the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Right. And peace negotiations should be conducted in that manner. When we come to the table, we shouldn&amp;#39;t negotiate right away. We should spend time walking together, eating together, making acquaintance, telling each other about our own suffering, without blame or condemnation. It takes maybe one, two, three weeks to do that. And if communication and understanding are possible, negotiation will be easier. So if I am to organize a peace negotiation, I will organize it in that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: You&amp;#39;d start with tea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: With tea and walking meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Mindful tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: And sharing our happiness and our suffering. And deep listening and loving speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Is there ever a place for anger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Anger is the energy that people use in order to act. But when you are angry, you are not lucid, and you might do wrong things. That is why compassion is a better energy. And the energy of compassion is very strong. We suffer. That is real. But we have learned not to get angry and not to allow ourselves to be carried by anger. We realize right away that that is fear. That is corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: What if in a moment of mindfulness you are being challenged? For instance, the other day someone presented me with a lawsuit, and it&amp;#39;s hard to feel happy when somebody is going to be taking you to court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: The practice is to go to the anxiety, the worry—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: The fear. First thing that happens is that fear sets in, like, What am I going to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: So you recognize that fear. You embrace it tenderly and look deeply into it. And as you embrace your pain, you get relief and you find out how to handle that emotion. And if you know how to handle the fear, then you have enough insight in order to solve the problem. The problem is to not allow that anxiety to take over. When these feelings arise, you have to practice in order to use the energy of mindfulness to recognize them, embrace them, look deeply into them. It&amp;#39;s like a mother when the baby is crying. Your anxiety is your baby. You have to take care of it. You have to go back to yourself, recognize the suffering in you, embrace the suffering, and you get relief. And if you continue with your practice of mindfulness, you understand the roots, the nature of the suffering, and you know the way to transform it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: You use the word suffering a lot. I think many people think suffering is dire starvation or poverty. But when you speak of suffering, you mean what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: I mean the fear, the anger, the despair, the anxiety in us. If you know how to deal with that, then you&amp;#39;ll be able to handle problems of war and poverty and conflicts. If we have fear and despair in us, we cannot remove the suffering in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: The nature of Buddhism, as I understand it, is to believe that we are all pure and radiant at our core. And yet we see around us so much evidence that people are not acting from a place of purity and radiance. How do we reconcile that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Well, happiness and suffering support each other. To be is to inter-be. It&amp;#39;s like the left and the right. If the left is not there, the right cannot be there. The same is true with suffering and happiness, good and evil. In every one of us there are good seeds and bad. We have the seed of brotherhood, love, compassion, insight. But we have also the seed of anger, hate, dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: That&amp;#39;s the nature of being human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes. There is the mud, and there is the lotus that grows out of the mud. We need the mud in order to make the lotus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Can&amp;#39;t have one without the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes. You can only recognize your happiness against the background of suffering. If you have not suffered hunger, you do not appreciate having something to eat. If you have not gone through a war, you don&amp;#39;t know the value of peace. That is why we should not try to run away from one thing after another thing. Holding our suffering, looking deeply into it, we find a way to happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Do you meditate every single day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: We try to do it not only every day but every moment. While drinking, while talking, while writing, while watering our garden, it&amp;#39;s always possible to practice living in the here and the now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: But do you ever sit silently with yourself or recite a mantra—or not recite a mantra?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes. We sit alone, we sit together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: The more people you sit with, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes, the collective energy is very helpful. I&amp;#39;d like to talk about the mantras you just mentioned. The first one is &amp;quot;Darling, I&amp;#39;m here for you.&amp;quot; When you love someone, the best you can offer is your presence. How can you love if you are not there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: That&amp;#39;s a lovely mantra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: You look into their eyes and you say, &amp;quot;Darling, you know something? I&amp;#39;m here for you.&amp;quot; You offer him or her your presence. You are not preoccupied with the past or the future; you are there for your beloved. The second mantra is, &amp;quot;Darling, I know you are there and I am so happy.&amp;quot; Because you are fully there, you recognize the presence of your beloved as something very precious. You embrace your beloved with mindfulness. And he or she will bloom like a flower. To be loved means to be recognized as existing. And these two mantras can bring happiness right away, even if your beloved one is not there. You can use your telephone and practice the mantra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Or e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: E-mail. You don&amp;#39;t have to practice it in Sanskrit or Tibetan—you can practice in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Darling, I&amp;#39;m here for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: And I&amp;#39;m very happy. The third mantra is what you practice when your beloved one is suffering. &amp;quot;Darling, I know you&amp;#39;re suffering. That is why I am here for you.&amp;quot; Before you do something to help, your presence already can bring some relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: The acknowledgment of the suffering or the hurting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes. And the fourth mantra is a little bit more difficult. It is when you suffer and you believe that your suffering has been caused by your beloved. If someone else had done the same wrong to you, you would have suffered less. But this is the person you love the most, so you suffer deeply. You prefer to go to your room and close the door and suffer alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: You are hurt. And you want to punish him or her for having made you suffer. The mantra is to overcome that: &amp;quot;Darling, I suffer. I am trying my best to practice. Please help me.&amp;quot; You go to him, you go to her, and practice that. And if you can bring yourself to say that mantra, you suffer less right away. Because you do not have that obstacle standing between you and the other person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: &amp;quot;Darling, I suffer. Please help me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: &amp;quot;Please help me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: What if he or she is not willing to help you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: First of all, when you love someone, you want to share everything with him or her. So it is your duty to say, &amp;quot;I suffer and I want you to know&amp;quot;—and he will, she will, appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: If he or she loves you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes. This is the case of two people who love each other. Your beloved one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: All right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: &amp;quot;And when I have been trying my best to look deeply, to see whether this suffering comes from my wrong perception and I might be able to transform it, but in this case I cannot transform it, you should help me, darling. You should tell me why you have done such a thing to me, said such a thing to me.&amp;quot; In that way, you have expressed your trust, your confidence. You don&amp;#39;t want to punish anymore. And that is why you suffer less right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Beautiful. Now I&amp;#39;m going to ask just a few questions about monkdom. Do you exercise to stay in shape?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes. We have the ten mindful movements. We do walking meditation every day. We practice mindful eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Are you vegetarian?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes. Vegetarian. Complete. We do not use animal products anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: So you wouldn&amp;#39;t eat an egg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: No egg, no milk, no cheese. Because we know that mindful eating can help save our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Do you watch television?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: No. But I&amp;#39;m in touch with the world. If anything really important happens, someone will tell me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: That&amp;#39;s the way I feel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: You don&amp;#39;t have to listen to the news three times a day or read one newspaper after another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: That&amp;#39;s right. Now, the life of a monk is a celibate life, correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: You never had trouble with the idea of giving up marriage or children?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: One day when I was in my 30s, I was practicing meditation in a park in France. I saw a young mother with a beautiful baby. And in a flash I thought that if I was not a monk, I would have a wife and a child like that. The idea lasted only for one second. I overcame it very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: That was not the life for you. And speaking of life, what about death? What happens when we die, do you believe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: The question can be answered when you can answer this: What happens in the present moment? In the present moment, you are producing thought, speech, and action. And they continue in the world. Every thought you produce, anything you say, any action you do, it bears your signature. Action is called karma. And that&amp;#39;s your continuation. When this body disintegrates, you continue on with your actions. It&amp;#39;s like the cloud in the sky. When the cloud is no longer in the sky, it hasn&amp;#39;t died. The cloud is continued in other forms like rain or snow or ice. Our nature is the nature of no birth and no death. It is impossible for a cloud to pass from being into nonbeing. And that is true with a beloved person. They have not died. They have continued in many new forms and you can look deeply and recognize them in you and around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Is that what you meant when you wrote one of my favorite poems, &amp;quot;Call Me By My True Name&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes. When you call me European, I say yes. When you call me Arab, I say yes. When you call me black, I say yes. When you call me white, I say yes. Because I am in you and you are in me. We have to inter-be with everything in the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: [Reading from the poem] &amp;quot;I am a mayfly metamorphosing on the surface of the river. And I am the bird that swoops down to swallow the mayfly.... I am the child in Uganda, all skin and bones, my legs as thin as bamboo sticks. And I am the arms merchant, selling deadly weapons to Uganda. I am the 12-year-old girl, refugee on a small boat, who throws herself into the ocean after being raped by a sea pirate. And I am the pirate, my heart not yet capable of seeing and loving.... Please call me by my true names, so I can hear all my cries and laughter at once, so I can see that my joy and pain are one. Please call me by my true names, so I can wake up and the door of my heart could be left open, the door of compassion.&amp;quot; What does that poem mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: It means compassion is our most important practice. Understanding brings compassion. Understanding the suffering that living beings undergo helps liberate the energy of compassion. And with that energy you know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Okay. At the end of this magazine, I have a column called &amp;quot;What I Know for Sure.&amp;quot; What do you know for sure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: I know that we do not know enough. We have to continue to learn. We have to be open. And we have to be ready to release our knowledge in order to come to a higher understanding of reality. When you climb a ladder and arrive on the sixth step and you think that is the highest, then you cannot come to the seventh. So the technique is to abandon the sixth in order for the seventh step to be possible. And this is our practice, to release our views. The practice of nonattachment to views is at the heart of the Buddhist practice of meditation. People suffer because they are caught in their views. As soon as we release those views, we are free and we don&amp;#39;t suffer anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: Isn&amp;#39;t the true quest to be free?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Yes. To be free, first of all, is to be free from wrong views that are the foundation of all kinds of suffering and fear and violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: It has been my honor to talk to you today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh: Thank you. A moment of happiness that might help people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: I think it will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s been a Buddhist monk for more than 60 years, as well as a teacher, writer and vocal opponent of war--a stance that left him exiled from his native Vietnam for four decades. Now he reflects on the beauty of the present moment, being grateful for every.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re planting seeds for new communities
It&amp;#39;s time to wake up
To be the change in the world we want to see
It&amp;#39;s time to open up
To redefine society
No, don&amp;#39;t give up
We&amp;#39;re planting seeds for new communities
Please wake up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wake up
Open your eyes
Wake up
Please realize
Wake up
You are skillful and wise
Wake up
(x2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She dreamed bigger, she dreamed brighter
She had the energy of wholeness to guide her
And when she stopped to look inside her
She listened to her inner voice and said:
I can feel it&amp;#39;s been my choice to live in this new way
To take time each day to meditate and to pray
It is a new day, and there is so much more I need to say
So I&amp;#39;ll be walking on the Earth in this sacred way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re planting seeds for new communities

Wake up
It&amp;#39;s a new sunrise
Wake up
You are beautiful and wise
Wake up
Wake up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on the path he could hear his heart whisper
Keep your spirit growing bigger, keep flowing in this river
Believe in yourself, let your heart be your guide
And you can use your suffering to grow your heart wide
There is more wonder in the world than you can see
Now stay true to your path, you don&amp;#39;t have to see how
Compassionate and kind to your body and your mind
Patience: it takes effort and time
One day at a time
One day at a time&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Bat Nha: a Koan&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh&amp;#39;s compassionate response to the persecution of his students in Vietnam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;The koan “Bat Nha” is everyone’s koan; it is the koan of every individual and every community. The koan can be practiced by a Bat Nha monastic, by a monk or nun studying at a Buddhist Institute in Vietnam, a Venerable in the Buddhist Church of Vietnam, a police officer, a Catholic priest, a Protestant minister, a Politburo member, a member of the Central Committee, a newspaper or magazine editor, an intellectual, an artist, a businessman, a teacher, a journalist, an abbot or abbess, an international political leader or ambassador. Bat Nha is an opportunity, because Bat Nha can help you see clearly what you couldn&amp;#39;t – or didn&amp;#39;t want – to see before.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1705&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;206&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Thay-portrait.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Thich Nhat Hanh[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not just look for what you want to see,
that would be futile.
Do not look for anything,
but allow the insight to have a chance to come by itself.
That insight will help liberate you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nhat Hanh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bat Nha&lt;/strong&gt; is a monastery in the central highlands of Vietnam, it is a community of monks and nuns being persecuted by the Vietnamese government, and it is the great crisis of Vietnamese Buddhism at the dawn of the 21st Century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A koan&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;known in Chinese as a gong an [&lt;strong&gt;公案&lt;/strong&gt;], and in Vietnamese as a cong an [&lt;strong&gt;công án&lt;/strong&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;) is a meditation device, a special kind of Zen riddle. Koans are solved not with the intellect but with the practice of mindfulness, concentration and insight. A koan can be contemplated and practiced individually or collectively, but so long as it remains unsolved, a koan is unsettling. It is like an arrow piercing our body which we cannot take out; so long as it is lodged there we can neither be happy nor at peace. Yet the koan&amp;#39;s arrow has not really come from outside, nor is it a misfortune. A koan is an opportunity to look deeply and transcend our worries and confusion. A koan forces us to address the great questions of life, questions about our future, about the future of our country and about our own true happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best known Zen koans include “The cypress in the courtyard”, “If everything returns to the one, where does the one return to?”, “Does a dog have Buddha nature?”, and “Who is invoking the Buddha’s name?” Vietnam&amp;#39;s great leaders and statesmen have long practiced the art of contemplating koans, and contributed many famous ones of their own1. Zen Master Tue Trung, whose brother General Tran Hung Dao repelled Genghis Khan&amp;#39;s invasion, offered the powerful koan “All phenomena are impermanent. Everything that is born must finally die. What is born, and what dies?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A koan cannot be solved by intellectual arguments, logic or reason, nor by debates such as whether there is only mind or matter. A koan can only be solved through the power of right mindfulness and right concentration. Once we have penetrated a koan, we feel a sense of relief, and have no more fears or questioning. We see our path and realize great peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Does a dog have Buddha nature?” If you think that it&amp;#39;s the dog&amp;#39;s problem whether or not he has Buddha nature, or if you think that it&amp;#39;s merely a philosophical conundrum, then it&amp;#39;s not a koan. “Where does the one return to?” If you think this is a question about the movement of an external objective reality, then that is not a koan either. If you think Bat Nha is only a problem for 400 monks and nuns in Vietnam, a problem that simply needs a ‘reasonable and appropriate’ solution, then that too is not a koan. Bat Nha truly becomes a koan only when you understand it as your own problem, one that deeply concerns your own happiness, your own suffering, your own future and the future of your country and your people. If you cannot solve the koan, if you cannot sleep, eat or work at peace, then Bat Nha has become your koan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Mindfulness&amp;#39; means to recollect something, to hold it in our heart day and night. The koan must remain in our consciousness every second, every minute of the day, never leaving us even for a moment. Mindfulness must be continuous and uninterrupted; and continuous mindfulness brings concentration. While eating, getting dressed, urinating and defecating, the practitioner needs to bring the koan to mind and look deeply into it.The koan is always at the forefront of your mind. Who is the Buddha whose name we should invoke? Who is doing the invoking? Who am I? You must find out. So long as you haven’t found out you haven&amp;#39;t made the breakthrough, you are not yet fully awake, you have not understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I AM A MONASTIC FROM THE BAT NHA COMMUNITY&lt;/strong&gt;. Bat Nha is my koan and I have the opportunity to look deeply into it in every moment of my daily life. Every day I contemplate the koan of Bat Nha – I sit with it in meditation, I walk with it in mindfulness, I am with it when I cook, when I wash my clothes, peel vegetables or sweep the floor; in every moment Bat Nha is my koan. I must produce mindfulness and concentration, because for me it is a matter of life and death, of my ideals and my future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know we’ve been successful in our practice, because despite all the oppression and harassment, many of us in our community can still laugh and be fresh as flowers. We are still able to generate peace and love, and not be dragged down by worries, fears or hatred. Yet there are those of us who are still suffering, weighed down by the trauma of the days when Bat Nha and Phuoc Hue Temple were attacked. One of the nuns offered an insight poem to our teacher. She wrote, “The Bat Nha of yesterday has become rain, falling to the earth, sprouting the seed of awakening.” This nun is barely 18 years old, not even two years ordained, but she has successfully penetrated the koan of Bat Nha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All we want is to practice – why can’t we? The senior monks of Vietnam want to protect and sponsor us – so why does the government stop them? We don’t know anything about politics, it doesn’t interest us at all – so why do they keep accusing us of meddling in politics and saying Bat Nha is a threat to national security? Why was dispersing Bat Nha so important that they had to resort to using hired mobs, slander, deceit, beatings and threats? The attackers were the age of our fathers and uncles; how could they have done that to us? If the government forbids us from living together and forces us, down to the last person, to scatter in all directions, how will our community ever be reunited? Why is it that in other countries people can practice this tradition freely, and we can&amp;#39;t?” These questions come up relentlessly and will not go away. They yearn to be answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the time of sitting meditation, walking meditation, or listening to a Dharma talk; while cooking, gardening, or doing other work in mindfulness, we generate the energy of mindfulness and concentration. This energy is like fire that burns away all the haunting thoughts and questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bat Nha of yesterday was happiness. We could be true to ourselves and live the way we wanted to live. For the first time in our lives we were in an environment where we could speak openly and share our deepest thoughts and feelings with our brothers and sisters – without suspicion, without fear of betrayal. We had the opportunity as young people to serve the world, in the spirit of true brotherhood and sisterhood. This was the greatest happiness. Then Bat Nha became a nightmare, but no-one will ever take from us the inner freedom we discovered there. I have found my path. Whether or not Bat Nha exists, I am no longer afraid. I can see that Bat Nha has become rain, helping the indestructible diamond seed of awakening to sprout within us. Even though we were forced from Phuoc Hue, and Bat Nha is no more, the seeds of awakening that have been planted in our hearts can never be taken away. Thay has taught each one of his students to become a Bat Nha, a Phuong Boi2. We are Thay&amp;#39;s continuation and we know that we will make many more Bat Nha’s and Phuong Boi’s in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already have the seed and we already have our path, so we are no longer afraid for the future – our own, or that of our country. Tomorrow we will have the chance to help those who persecute us today. They may not see that now, but later they will understand. We know that many of those who attacked us and made us suffer have already begun to see the truth. Prejudices and wrong perceptions like those that built the Berlin Wall eventually collapse and disintegrate. There is no need to worry or despair. We can laugh as brightly as the morning sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I AM A CHIEF OF POLICE IN VIETNAM&lt;/strong&gt;. At first, I believed that the order from my superiors to wipe out Bat Nha must have been justified, that it must have been in the interests of national security. I trusted my superiors. However, as I carried out the order, I saw things that broke my heart. Bat Nha has become a koan for my life. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep. I toss and turn throughout the night. I ask myself, What have these people done, that I should treat them as reactionaries and threats to public safety? They seem so peaceful – but I have no peace at all. If I don’t have peace in my heart, how can I keep the peace in my society?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young monks and nuns have not broken any laws. In fact we were the ones who collaborated with those who seized their property. We forced them to leave the place they helped to build, where they had been living peacefully for years. We tried everything to force them out, yet they held their ground. They seemed to have so much love for each other – there seemed to be something that bound them together. They lived with such integrity. Even though they were young, none of them was pulled into smoking, drug abuse or empty sex. They lived simply, ate vegan food, sat in meditation, listened to sutras, shared with each other and did no harm to anyone. How can we say they are dangerous? They have never said or done anything against the government. We cannot truthfully say they are reactionaries or involved in politics. And yet we have accused them of that and driven them out by every possible means: we threatened them, we cut off their electricity and water, we went every night for many months to harass them, demanding to see their identification papers, over and over again; we did everything we could to break their spirit. But they never said a reproachful word, they offered us tea, they sang for us and they asked to take souvenir photos with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end we hired mobs to destroy their community, to assault them and expel them. We had to be there wearing plainclothes to identify and single out the leaders so the thugs could neutralize and abduct them. Not once did they fight back. Their only weapons were chanting the Buddha’s name, sitting in meditation, and locking arms to stop us from separating them as we forced them into the waiting cars. Central government even sent a Major General to coordinate the attack. Why did we need to mobilize such a massive force, from the central to the local government, to break up a group of young people with empty hands and innocent hearts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why did it take us more than a year to kick them out? What was there in the temple that made them so determined to stay? Every day they had just two vegan meals, three sessions of sitting meditation, one lecture and one session of walking meditation. Why were there so many of them, so young and yet living so harmoniously with each other? Some of them had university diplomas, some were sons and daughters of high-ranking officials, some had had careers and high-paying jobs; but they left it all behind for a humble life. What was so good there that it attracted so many young people? How can we just say that they were tricked by the honeyed words of a person living in the West into opposing the government?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My orders came from above and I had to obey; but I feel deeply ashamed. At first I thought they were just temporary measures, for the greater good of the country, for the sake of preserving national unity. Now I know that the whole operation was deceitful, cruel and offensive to human conscience. I am forced to keep these thoughts to myself. I don’t dare to share them with the officers in my unit, let alone my superiors. I can’t go forward and I can’t go back; I am a cog in a machine and I can’t get out. What must I do to be true to myself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I AM A MEMBER OF THE BUDDHIST CHURCH OF VIETNAM&lt;/strong&gt;. Bat Nha haunts me night and day. I know those young monastics are practicing the true Dharma. Everyone who has come into contact with them confirms this. So why are we powerless to protect them? Why do we have to live and behave like government employees? When will I realize my dream of practicing religion without political interference? During the periods of foreign colonization, or the Diem and Thieu regimes, Buddhists faced hardships; but monastics were never as tightly controlled as they are now. What the officials want today is a Buddhism based on blind faith and rituals, not a Buddhism that offers true spiritual guidance and has the capacity to promote an ethical way of living. They are afraid of a Buddhism that offers powerful spiritual leadership, and only accept religious organizations that can be controlled and manipulated. But when the Buddha was alive, he refused to submit to domination, even that of King Ajatasattu. During the French colonization and the Diem, Ky and Thieu regimes, our ancestors fought for liberty. Why are we not continuing that work? Why have we allowed ourselves to become the instruments of a policy that is trampling our ideal of service, our noble aspiration of awakening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought that if I went along with the government, I would at least have a chance to do some of the ‘Buddha’s work,’ whereas if I opposed the government totally then I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to do anything. And so I had to silently suffer the criticism and scorn of my colleagues for being in the system. After a while, however, I saw that it was thanks to the ability and courage of those outside the Buddhist Church to voice their protests that I was permitted to do Buddhist work, albeit in a limited way. When the history of Vietnamese Buddhism is written, how will I answer for this? My aim was to revive Buddhism in order to serve the people and the nation, not to become part of a system that exists to monitor and control Buddhists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That venerable, who was pressured into withdrawing his sponsorship for the monks and nuns to stay and practice at his temple: he did not have the strength to resist. He was compelled to betray his teacher and his friends and break the deep vow he made just a few years ago. It is a tragedy for him. But who is that monk? Is he someone else, or is he none other than myself? He is in me. I am also being pressured, and don’t dare to do or say what I really believe in order to protect my spiritual children and young brothers and sisters. Isn&amp;#39;t it my deepest desire to ‘Guide the future generations, and repay my debt of gratitude to the Buddha?’ If so, then how can I justify the fact that I stood by helplessly and watched as the young monks and nuns, my spiritual descendents, were oppressed, humiliated and trampled upon? How can I dare to look my spiritual children, my continuation, in the eyes? What is my true face? Who am I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are brothers and sisters, children of the Buddha. Is it because our practice of brotherhood is not solid enough that they have been able to divide us, that we have fallen into blaming and hating each other? According to the Buddha’s teaching of non-dualism, whether we follow the Unified Buddhist Church or the Buddhist Church of Vietnam, we are still brothers and sisters in the same family. We can do what we have to do without fighting or opposing each other, without having to consider each other as enemies. Has this enmity arisen because our practice is still weak? Has this happened because our spiritual power is not great enough? But surely we have learned a lesson: if we can accept each other and reconcile with one another, we can still resurrect our brotherhood and sisterhood, inspire the confidence of our fellow citizens and be role models for everyone. Even though we’ve left it until it’s too late, the situation can still be saved. Just one moment of awakening is enough to change the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems the monks and nuns of Bat Nha have learned this lesson. Even when they were attacked and expelled they never showed any resentment toward the venerable abbot who had taken them in during these years. They knew that he was under intense pressure to force them out and that eventually he crumbled. If we in the Buddhist Church have been cornered into betraying our own brothers and sisters it is because our spiritual integrity is not yet strong enough. How can we be wholehearted and determined enough in our daily practice to attain the spiritual strength we need? Only when we understand can we love. When we love each other we cannot see each other as enemies. As long as we see each other as enemies, we will fall prey to schemes of division and separation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bat Nha isn&amp;#39;t just an issue for the Central Buddhist Church of Vietnam to resolve. Bat Nha is a koan, the challenge of our lives. How can we solve it in such a way that we are not ashamed before our ancestors? Why can’t I share my thoughts and feelings with my friends in the Central Buddhist Church of Vietnam? Why aren&amp;#39;t we allowed to harmonize our views? Why do we have to hide our thoughts and feelings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vietnamese Buddhists have respected and followed the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha for the last two thousand years. But now groups of people were hired who wore shoes into the Buddha Hall, who put up offensive banners on the altar, who yelled and cursed and threw human excrement at venerable monks, who destroyed sacred objects, and who violently attacked, beat and expelled monks and nuns from their temple. It was government officers who hired them and said they were Buddhists. This is an ugly stain on the history of Buddhism in Vietnam. It disgusts us and sickens us, yet why don&amp;#39;t we dare to speak out? Can the Buddhist Church of Vietnam, whose members were slandered, falsely accused and framed by the government, shake off this insult and prove the innocence of Vietnamese Buddhists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I AM A HIGH RANKING MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM&lt;/strong&gt;. Bat Nha is an opportunity for me to look deeply at the truth and find peace in my own heart and mind. If I don&amp;#39;t have peace, how can I have happiness? But how can I have peace, when I don’t really believe in the path I walk on, and especially when I don&amp;#39;t have faith or trust in those I call my comrades? We may be bedfellows, but are we dreaming different dreams? Why can’t I share my real thoughts and feelings with those I call my comrades? Am I afraid of being denounced? Of losing my position? Why do we all have to say exactly the same things when none of us believe it? Isn&amp;#39;t this a case of The Emperor’s New Clothes, where all the members of the Emperor’s court swear the Emperor is wearing a beautiful robe, when in fact he is completely naked?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My greatest dream is for my own happiness to be in harmony with my country&amp;#39;s. Just as trees have their roots and water has its source, our homeland has its heritage of spiritual insight. The Ly dynasty was the most peaceful and compassionate dynasty in our country&amp;#39;s history. Under the Tran dynasty, the People&amp;#39;s unity was strong enough to enable them to push back the attacks from the North. This unity was possible thanks to Buddhism&amp;#39;s contribution as an inclusive and accepting spiritual path, that could co-exist with other spiritual and ethical traditions, such as Taoism and Confucianism, and so build a country that never needed to expel or eliminate anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had the opportunity to study. I know Buddhism is not a theistic religion but is solidly humanist. Buddhism is open-minded and undogmatic; it has the spirit of rational enquiry. In the new century, Buddhism can go hand in hand with science. &amp;#39;Science&amp;#39; here means the spirit of scientific inquiry, the willingness to let go of old views in order to embrace new ones that are closer to reality. Modern science has gone far beyond traditional science, especially in the area of quantum physics. Is what I took for science in the past still science today? Mind and matter are just two manifestations of one reality. They contain one another and depend on one another to manifest. Modern science is putting all its energy into overcoming dualistic ways of thinking – about mind and matter, inside and outside, subject and object, space and time, mass and speed, and so on. If I am still caught in my anger, anxiety, craving and discrimination, then my mind cannot be collected and concentrated enough to see the truth. No matter how sophisticated the instruments are that I use, behind all that technology there is still the mind that observes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my heart I know that the people supported the revolution so strongly because they loved their country, not an ideology. If the people&amp;#39;s support had been based only on an ideology, and not on their deep love for the country, then we would surely have failed. I know that in the 1940s some of us, out of zealous and fanatical devotion to an ideology, crushed and assassinated revolutionaries fighting alongside us against foreign aggressors. To this day, the wounds of that time have not been healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for class struggle, I should ask myself: Which class is holding power now? The proletariat or the capitalists? Is there such a thing as &amp;#39;The People’s Capitalism&amp;#39;, or is that just a convenient fiction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to be successful, the Party&amp;#39;s policy must reflect the People&amp;#39;s deep wishes (Y Dang, Long Dan). The People&amp;#39;s deep wish is for monks and nuns to have the freedom to practice and help the world according to their ideal, in line with the laws of the land. The People’s deep wish is for every citizen to be able to speak his or her mind without fear of denunciation or arrest. The People&amp;#39;s deep wish is to separate religion from political affairs, and take the politics out of religion. If the deep wishes of the People are satisfied, then there will naturally be unity, and the Party will be supported. If the Party were in harmony with the hearts of the People, the Party would no longer need to appeal for unity or support. Such is the wish of the People. What is the policy of the party?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that during the Tran and Ly dynasties, Buddhism&amp;#39;s spirit of inclusiveness united the whole nation. Thanks to that spirit, everyone who loved their country had an opportunity to contribute to the work of building and protecting the nation, and no-one was excluded. This spirit of inclusiveness in Buddhism is called &amp;#39;equanimity&amp;#39;, and is one of the four Buddhist virtues, alongside loving kindness, compassion and joy. Inclusiveness is a precious spiritual heritage, a cultural treasure. I know that during the Ly and Tran dynasties, kings and politicians practiced Buddhism just as the people did. By keeping the Buddhist precepts, following a vegetarian diet and doing good works, they were able to earn their people&amp;#39;s trust and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we eradicate the hideous social evils of drug abuse, prostitution, gambling, violence, corruption and abuse of power, when the officials responsible for abolishing them are themselves caught up in those very evils? How can the government&amp;#39;s policy of &amp;#39;cultural districts&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;cultural villages&amp;#39; ever be successful if it is based merely on perfunctory inspections and punishment? Who is the one that needs to be inspected and who is the one that needs to be punished?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that any family that practices and keeps the mindfulness trainings enjoys peace, joy and happiness. For the last two thousand years, Buddhism has been teaching people how to live ethical lives, be vegetarian and keep the trainings. Following a vegetarian diet is a sign of mastery over the craving mind, of not giving in to desires. When Buddhists observe a vegetarian diet, keep the trainings and do good deeds, they do so voluntarily and not by force or fear of punishment. At this very time, the young monks and nuns of Bat Nha are going in this direction, reinvigorating this ethical way of living. They have the potential to succeed. So why do we want to repress them and wipe them out? Are we afraid that if they have mass support, it will be at our expense? Why can&amp;#39;t I open my heart to practice like them, to be one with them and benefit from their support? Why can’t we do as the kings of the Tran and Ly dynasties did? Just because we are Marxists, does that mean we don’t have the right to take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, to be vegetarian and practice the mindfulness trainings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that in the party and in the government, many people now claim to be open-minded towards religion and spirituality. In fact, all the top officials believe in things like feng shui, destiny, psychic powers and even the idea of extending one person&amp;#39;s lifespan by transferring life-years from someone else. They have gone from one extreme to another. And yet they outwardly claim not to be superstitious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ly and Tran kings truly believed in a path of virtue and spirituality. Many of them lived exemplary ethical lives, and the people had confidence in them and were inspired to do the same. One king knew how to practice the mindfulness trainings, followed a vegetarian diet, sent blankets to prisons, and went out into towns and villages to meet the people and see the truth of how they lived and what they suffered. A king who knows how to do sitting meditation, look deeply into koans, practice beginning anew six times daily, write commentaries on sutras, take refuge in the wise counsel of a Zen master whom he respects as the national teacher, and yield the throne to his son in order to become a simple monk on Yen Tu mountain – such a king can be a great example of morality for the whole nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays we&amp;#39;re always urging government officials and one another to “study and follow the virtuous example of Ho Chi Minh”. But who is the one that is living a good example for their comrades? Mahayana Buddhism teaches that “You have to be that person. You have to be the role model. You have to live that way yourself. Only then will you give others the inspiration to do the same.” I have to be that person. I know that corruption and abuse of power have become a national catastrophe. We have been lamenting it for so many years already, and yet the situation just gets worse with every passing day. Why? Is it because I&amp;#39;m only able to proudly boast of my ancestors’ glorious past, and am not in fact able to do as they did? And today, when there are young people actually doing it, why do we block and suppress them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bat Nha situation may have started with a travel agency owned by a high police officer. Soon it involved hotels, then visas, and eventually the abuse of power and the exercise of revenge. Now it has become a policy the whole country has to follow. Maybe I have not taken the time to examine this. I just go along with the false reports and casually allow the people I am supervising to use lies, deception and oppression against these gentle people who never have caused any disturbance to society. In the end I am put in a position where I become the enemy of the very things I once cherished. Are my true enemies really outside of me? My enemies are within. Do I have enough courage and intelligence to face my own weaknesses? That is the fundamental question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plum Village practices offer a rare opportunity to modernize Buddhism in Vietnam; the last four years have proved their effectiveness. Why are we allowing ourselves to be pressured by our powerful neighbor into persecuting and destroying such a precious living treasure? What will we get that is so precious, in return for destroying this treasure we already have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to celebrate the thousand-year anniversary of Hanoi is to strive to practice, to live like our great ancestors Ly Cong Uan, Tran Thai Tong, Tran Thanh Tong, Truc Lam Dai Si, and Master Tue Trung. They were politicians, but at the same time lived a true spiritual life that they believed in. What have I to be proud of, other than the legends of my ancestors? I have lost my revolutionary ideal. I have snuffed out the sacred flame of my aspiration. My comrades are no longer truly my comrades because their own sacred flame of revolutionary idealism has gone out. They are only in the Party for self-interest, fame and status. The Plum Village tradition is part of my country’s cultural heritage and is contributing to a global cultural ethic – not just in theory but, most importantly, in practice. So many people all around the world have heard about this tradition and are benefiting from these teachings. I should be proud of this, so why did I allow the tradition to be attacked and wiped out in the very land where it was born? These are the questions that, if allowed to penetrate and act upon the depths of my consciousness, can awaken the wisdom within. This will give me the insight I need to see the path and way out I have been longing for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I AM A HEAD OF STATE OR FOREIGN MINISTER&lt;/strong&gt;. My country is or is not a member of the Security Council or the UN Commission on Human Rights. I know that events like Bat Nha, Tam Toa, Tiananmen Square and the annexation of Tibet are serious violations of Human Rights. But because of national interest, because our country wants to continue to do business with them, because we want to sell arms, airplanes, fast trains, nuclear power plants and other technologies, because we want a market for our products, I cannot express myself frankly and make real decisions that can create pressure on that country so they stop violating human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel ashamed. My conscience is not at peace but because I want my party and my government to succeed, I tell myself that these violations are not serious enough for my country to take a stance. It seems that I too am caught in a system, a kind of machinery, and I cannot really be myself. I’m not able to give voice to my real feelings or to speak out about the situation. What do I have to do to get the peace that I so badly need? Bat Nha is of course a situation in Vietnam, but it has also become a koan for a high-ranking political leader like me. What path can I take in order to really be myself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The koan “Bat Nha” is everyone’s koan; it is the koan of every individual and every community. The koan can be practiced by a Bat Nha monastic, by a monk or nun studying at a Buddhist Institute in Vietnam, a Venerable in the Buddhist Church of Vietnam, a police officer, a Head of Department, a Catholic priest, a Protestant minister, a Politburo member, a Chairman of a city&amp;#39;s People’s Committee, a Provincial Party Secretary, a member of the Central Committee, a newspaper or magazine editor, an intellectual, an artist, a businessman, a teacher, a journalist, an abbot or abbess, an international political leader or ambassador. Bat Nha is an opportunity, because Bat Nha can help you see clearly what you couldn&amp;#39;t – or didn&amp;#39;t want – to see before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Zen tradition, there are retreats of seven, twenty-one and forty-nine days. During these retreats, the practitioner invests their whole heart and mind into the koan. Every moment of their daily life is also a moment of looking deeply: when sitting, walking, breathing, eating, brushing their teeth or washing their clothes. At every moment the mind is concentrated on the koan. The most popular retreat is the seven-day retreat. Every day the practitioner gets the chance to interact with the Zen master in the direct guidance session. The Zen master offers guidance to help the practitioner direct their concentration in the correct way, opening up their mind and helping them to see, showing them the situation so the truth can reveal itself clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the direct guidance sessions the truth is not transmitted from master to practitioner. Practitioners must realize the truth for themselves. The Zen master may give about ten minutes of guidance, to open your mind and point things out, and then everyone returns to their own sitting place to continue to look deeply. Sometimes there are hundreds of practitioners, all sitting together in the meditation hall, facing the wall. After a period of sitting meditation, there is a period of walking meditation. Practitioners walk slowly, each and every step bringing them back to the koan. At meal times, practitioners may eat at their meditation cushion. While eating they contemplate the koan. Urinating and defecating are also opportunities to look deeply. Noble silence is essential for meditative enquiry, and that is why outside the meditation hall there is always a sign that reads ‘Noble Silence.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, King Tran Thai Tong became enlightened by investigating the two koans ‘Four mountains’ and ‘A true person has no position’. Zen master Lieu Quan became enlightened thanks to his practice of the koan ‘The all proceeds to the one; where does the one go?’. He presented his insight at Tu Dam Temple in the city of Hue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be successful in your practice of koans, you must be able to let go of all intellectual knowledge, all notions and all points of view you currently hold. If you are caught in a personal opinion, standpoint, or ideology, you do not have enough freedom to allow the koan&amp;#39;s insight to break forth into your consciousness. You have to release everything you have encountered before, everything you have previously taken to be the truth. As long as you believe you already hold the truth in your hand, the door to your mind is closed. Even if the truth comes knocking, you will not be able to receive it. Present knowledge is an obstacle. Buddhism demands freedom. Freedom of thought is the basic condition for progress. It is the true spirit of science. It is precisely in that space of freedom that the flower of wisdom can bloom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Zen tradition, community is a very positive element. When hundreds of practitioners silently look deeply together, the collective energy of mindfulness and concentration is very powerful. This collective energy nourishes your concentration in every minute and every second, giving you the opportunity to have a breakthrough in your practice of the koan. This kind of environment is very different from that of a conference, discussion or meeting. The firm discipline of your meditation practice, the favorable environment for concentration, as well as the guidance of the Zen master and silent support of fellow practitioners, all provide you with many opportunities to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggestions given above can be seen as direct guidance to help you in your practice of looking deeply. You have to see these words as an instrument, not as the truth. They are the raft that can bring you to the other shore; they are not the shore itself. Once you reach the other shore, you have to abandon the raft. If you are successful in looking deeply, you will have freedom, you will be able to see your path. Then you can just burn these words, or throw them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish you all success in the work of looking deeply into the Bat Nha koan,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long ago, Vietnam’s King Tran Thai Tong practiced Zen. He meditated on koans and contributed forty new koans, as well as various invocations, recitations and short verses, for friends to practice with him at the palace&amp;#39;s True Teachings Temple. These koans have been recorded in his book, Instructions on Emptiness. Master Tue Trung, a lay man, composed thirteen of his own koans, which are recorded in the Record of Zen Master Tue Trung. The Blue Cliff Record, edited by Zen master Yuan Wu in the twelfth century, has over 100 koans complete with teachings, commentaries and guidelines. This classic has been used by Zen practitioners for centuries.↩&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Bat Nha: The Indestructible Seed of Awakening&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fragrant Source Inner Monastery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The last days of 2009&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To my Bat Nha children,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that in these moments, you have to disperse to many places, and you cannot live together to practice as a monastic community anymore, but I trust that my letter will still reach you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2058&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;256&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/seed-of-awakening-chanting.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Still Water Meditation Hall - Upper Hamlet[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday 20th, 2009, brothers and sisters from the four Plum Village monasteries gathered to have a Day of Mindfulness. It had been six months that we had to organize days of mindfulness outdoor in the Dharma Cloud Temple of Upper Hamlet, because the meditation hall was under construction. Last Sunday, the meditation hall Still Water had been finished, and thus this was the first time that the community could use the meditation hall again. The new meditation hall is very large and beautiful, a lot larger and more beautiful than the old meditation hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monks and lay men of the Upper Hamlet worked together to design and build this meditation hall. They worked as a Sangha, and during six months, they had the opportunity to cultivate and expand their brotherhood. Looking into the meditation hall, everyone can see the Sangha and that brotherhood. Each roof tile, each floor tile, each window frame carries remnants of laughter, the look, the hands and drops of sweat of each person in the community. The brothers from the Lower Mountain Temple as well as the sisters from the New Hamlet and the Low Hamlet also came to contribute a work day every so often. The meditation hall is beautiful, but if we look at the meditation hall and we cannot yet see the brotherhood and sisterhood of the Sangha, then we do not yet ưhensee the meditation hall’s true beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of our Winter Retreat this year is The Art of Happiness, and the Sangha has just finished learning the Discourse on Happiness, Sakya Muni Discourse, and the transmission gatha of the Lieu Quan Dharma linage. The community practices the fifth mantra “this is a happy moment” very diligently, recognizing many happy moments of living and practicing together. The weekly monastic days organized at the Fragrant Stream Hermitage bring a lot of nourishment and happiness to the Sangha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone agrees that if we remember to practice the fifth mantra, it will be effective immediately. We only need to return to the present moment, to see that we (despite everything) are still more fortunate (than many people), then we can smile and say out loud: “This is a happy moment,” so that the people around us can also return to the present moment and be nourished by happiness like we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2059&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/source-of-happiness-300x231.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Source of Happiness[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My children, Thay hopes that wherever you are, you can listen to the Dharma talks and practice according to the instructions given during this winter retreat. You need to be nourished by the Dharma Happiness and by your own practice, so that you can go through this difficult time of the Bat Nha Sangha. I have great confidence and trust in you. You have grown up quickly, thanks to the difficult events taken place over the last year, and I feel very pleased with your non-violent, loving and harmonious behaviors, from Bat Nha to Phuoc Hue Temple. History has witnessed that, with your loving and harmonious behaviors, you have planted and watered the seed of faith, understanding and love in many people’s hearts, including those who were hired to come to disturb and oppress us. This is the greatest success that we have accomplished; it is greater than any impressive stupa or temple building projects. On the eighteenth of this last December, Brother Trung Hai, Sister Giac Nghiem and a number of brothers and sisters represented the Bat Nha Sangha to go to Elysees to give a letter to the French president Nicolas Sarkozy, requesting that 400 monastic members of the Bat Nha Sangha may temporarily reside in France, in order to continue to practice as a community, until the Vietnamese government opens their heart to allow the Bat Nha Sangha to do so right on our homeland. In fact, according to the present laws, we have the right to live and practice anywhere in country, but it is not certain why we cannot benefit from these rights when we have not violated any laws, and when we only want to practice and guide others to practice within the laws of the land and of the Buddhist tradition. The national and international opinions, amongst Buddhists as well as non-Buddhists, are clearly supportive of us. Therefore, I believe that my children will not have to endure these difficulties for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many friends have understood the essential needs to practice as a Sangha, so they were not happy when they heard that we must disperse, each person going his/her own way and practicing by himself/herself. The Buddhist tradition generally and the Plum Village tradition specifically do not accept this imposition. When a monk leaves his community, his spiritual life is dead, just like when a tiger leaves the mountain, it is killed. This statement is the ancient wisdom: If you practice without a community, your practice will wither and fade away, the way the tiger leaving his kingdom in the forest and mountain to go to the lowland, humans will kill him and take his skin. Our tradition is to go as a river. We cannot go as a drop of water. A drop of water if traveling alone on its way back the ocean, it will evaporate mid-way and never reach the ocean. Who amongst us do not know the song “We vow to be the river, not the small drops of water” written by Sister Hoa Nghiem? Therefore, dispersing the Sangha is the greatest ordeal to the spiritual practitioners. Spiritual practitioners must always take refuge in the Sangha Jewel. The Sangha is a community of practitioners. To build a Sangha brings a lot of merits and happiness, and to destroy a Sangha brings as much misfortunes and doom. I fear for those who have the unwholesome intention to destroy the harmony of the Sangha. This is the greatest violation amongst all violations. If the President of France allows the Sangha to reside in France, he will gain many merits and much happiness, won’t he, my children? Even if it is only a temporary stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each one amongst us has three bodies: The Buddha body, the Dharma body, and the Sangha body. The Buddha body in us is still immature and weak, so it must be nourished by our daily practice. It is the seed of wisdom, compassion and loving kindness in us. It is our Buddha nature. The Dharma body is our daily diligent practice, which has the capacity to nourish and strengthen our Buddha body. The Sangha body is the community that we are taking refuge in, living together in order to practice. Our community is our body. If the community is dispersed, then the Sangha body no longer exists. The Sangha body is the environment that protects, nourishes and shines light on us. We have to take refuge in the Sangha body, and we have to see that the Sangha body is our body and whatever happens to the Sangha body, it is happening to us. Therefore, a monastic practitioner makes the vow to take refuge in the Sangha, never leaves the Sangha, just like the tiger never leaves its deep mountain and forest. Knowing that losing the Sangha is a great accident, you have done your best to practice non-violence in order to protect the Sangha, so that the Sangha does not fall apart. People with power in their hands need to understand this, and if they do not yet understand, we have to find ways to help them to understand it. Non-violence was the method used by the Buddha when his Sangha in the Vulture Peak was discriminated against and oppressed by the king Asajatu. King Asajatu intentionally tried to divide the Sangha and to destroy the Sangha harmony, and he suffered from a mental illness in the following years, that at the end, he had to come to the Buddha to ask for healing. You have learned this from the book Old Path White Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahatma Gandhi also applied non-violence to fight for India’s independence. He said: “Passive resistance, that is, soul force, is matchless. It is superior to the force of arms. Not the weapon of the weak.” This unforgettable statement by Saint Gandhi was made on April 29th, 1933. He also added that in order to succeed in his service for the country, a non-violent practitioner must be determined to keep the precepts. “To observe morality is to attain mastery over our mind and our passion. So doing, we know ourselves.” Saint Gandhi also shared his practice experience and struggle in very concrete terms: “After a great deal of experience, it seems to me that those who want to become passive resisters for the service of the country have to observe perfect chastity, adopt poverty, follow truth and cultivate fearlessness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the entire time of his struggle for India’s independence, Mahatma Gandhi lived in this spirit. He ate vegetarian food, he slept on the ground, and he observed chastity – a lifestyle just exactly like that of a monastic practitioner. The people in that movement had great faith in their path and they also learned to live that ascetic and purifying life. The struggle movement was called Satyagraha, which means holding fast to the truth. It is to keep your mind clear, not using any method that is against ethics, always respecting the truth. The opponents may trick, lie, go back on their words, resort to lowly methods, but on the side of the passive resisters, morality and truth have to be the essence and the foundation for all behaviors and actions. Non-violence is not only the outward form, but it is the essential content of the ideal inwardly. We must cultivate compassion, loving kindness, and non-hatred, and we must have the capacity to endure violence without fighting back, true to “The Four Ways of Meeting with Certain Situations” that the Buddha advised the fully ordained monks [bhikshu] and nuns [bhikshuni] to practice and to recite every two weeks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bhikshu/bhikshuni who is insulted by someone, shall not insult that person in return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bhikshu/bhikshuni whom someone is angry with shall not be angry with that person in return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bhikshu/bhikshuni who is belittled by someone, shall not belittle that person in return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bhikshu/bhikshuni who is beaten by someone, shall not beat that person in return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2067&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;186&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/freedom-wherever-we-go.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Freedom Wherever We Go[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were able to carry out these four ways of meeting with certain situations during the days that you were attacked by the mobs. As a result, you had the opportunity to touch so many people, waking them up and helping them to transform. Brothers Phap Hoi, Phap Sy and Phap Tu were dragged, throttled, suffocated and thrown into cars as if they were trashcans. Their faces were bruised, their necks and shoulders bled. Brother Phap Vinh was kicked and his body rolled down the stairs; thankfully, he did not break his leg. Brother Dong Tinh and young aspirant Binh Minh (now a novice in the Pink Lotus family) were beaten until they fainted, but never once fought back. Some people got their hands cut by the broken glass while they were destroying the monastery properties, and their wounds were cleaned and dressed by the sisters. Many of these images were recorded in video, and they touched many people deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the people want democracy and human rights, they have to know how to struggle for it, and the struggle may have to go on for many centuries. We are monastic practitioners, so we are not present in the political struggle movements, but only in the areas of culture and ethics. Back then, Siddhartha [the young prince who later became the Buddha] refused the political path in order to go on the spiritual moral path. Siddhartha also met difficulties. We practice in order to enliven a healthy culture, a way of life that has the quality of morality, loving kindness and compassion, and the best way we strive for this is to practice and share the teachings and practices with others. The society nowadays is full of social evils: corruption, power abuse, drug addiction, violence, prostitution, broken families, suicide, and reckless sexual activities. We practice and organize retreats for others to practice in order to address, prevent and cleanse those social evils, and that is the way we love our country and our people. We are citizens of an independent country, with constitution and proper laws, and we have the right to carry out this work. No one can strip off these rights from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my first trip back to our country in 2005, Thay saw banners which read “cultural town,” “cultural village,” “cultural area,” etc. I was quietly happy, thinking that this was an intelligent and prompt policy of the government. Asking about it, I learned that the policy of forming those cultural towns and areas was to address the already spreading social evils such as drug addiction, prostitution, gambling, violence, etc. After being in Vietnam for a month, I was told that the government did not succeed much with those cultural towns and areas. They were only words, but not truths. The methods to control and to punish were not enough to dispel the social evils, especially when the people who carry out the control and punishment are also caught in social evils such as corruption, power abuse and treachery. Then, I saw very clearly that only true ethical training and practice could address the situation. You already know that every family that can practice the Five Mindfulness Trainings, there is harmony and happiness in that family. And no one can force us to practice the Five Mindfulness Trainings if we do not have faith in the teachings and in the precepts. As a result, in the monastic retreat at our root temple Tu Hieu (from March 7th to March 12th, 2005), I proposed a model of a village or a town in which the temple plays the leading role in ethics; the monks or nuns in that temple observe stably the precepts and mindful manners, organize retreats for adults, teenagers and children, inspire confidence in a spiritual ethical path and encourage people to receive, practice the Five Mindfulness Trainings, and to come to the temple to recite the trainings, have Dharma discussions and reflect on their own practice every half month. This is not something new. It is only the work of modernizing the old practice tradition, and the leaders, facilitators must have the proper reputation and ability to guide the youth as well as others, including the educated, business, and political people. And if we want to accomplish this, we have to begin to train a generation of new monks and nuns. That was the content of the monastic retreat at our root temple Tu Hieu, where almost one thousand young monastics attended and these Dharma talks were made into the book Building Brotherhood and Sisterhood (Xây Dựng Tình Huynh Đệ). In my mind, Bat Nha monastery at that time was already formed. Bat Nha Monastery would be the role model amongst the centers training new monastics like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precepts and mindful manners are not something that restrict or lessen human freedom. Precepts and mindful manners, on the other hand, have the capacity to protect freedom. Someone who practices not drinking alcohol and not using drugs has the freedom one thousand times greater than another person who does not practice this precept, because when this latter person is caught in drunkenness and addiction, he/she has no more freedom, and he/she is ready to violate other precepts such as lying, stealing, killing others, etc. in order to get the money to buy drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that if people do not keep the precepts, then a family with 3, 4 people still has many problems, causing each other endless suffering. If precepts and mindful manners are observed diligently, then even though it is a community of 400 people, we still can live together in harmony, trust and joy. Bat Nha Sangha proved this powerfully. Others accused us, that we did not keep the precepts, and that we slept with each other, so that they had a chance to destroy us. They even brought pornographic materials with them in order to put this accusation on us. It was one of the lowliest means of behaviors. Everyone knows that if we did not observe the precepts and mindful manners, we would not trust each other, we can never be able to live together, have such solidarity and love one another like blood relatives as we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of the Buddha, a group of non-Buddhist practitioners also accused the Buddha’s Sangha like that. While the monks went into the city of Sravasti to beg for food, those people brought the corpse of a singer to the Jeta Monastery, buried her there and then informed the police. They spread the news that the monks in the monastery did not keep their precepts. The King Pasedena and the people in the city were very confused. Many monks did not dare to go out on alms round. The Buddha told the monks: “Do not worry. The truth will reveal itself in ten days. You should go into the city for alms round as if nothing had happened.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devoted follower Anathapindika heard about the situation, and he had detectives to go find out the truth and, in the end, the police were able to arrest the perpetrators. They admitted that they had done such thing because they saw the Buddha’s Sangha was too famous, the people followed the Sangha in great numbers, and they were afraid that they would lose their stand amongst the people. King Pasedena, after having had the clear evidence, punished these accusers appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2060&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;320&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/bat_nha_monastery_vietnam.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Meditation Hall, Bat Nha Monastery - Vietnam[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bat Nha situation is more complicated than that of the Jeta Monastery, because in the case of Bat Nha and Phuoc Hue, the mobs were hired and the government officials hired them and worked together with them. They were two, but they were also one, whereas the king Pasedena was someone with deep reverence towards the Buddha. We also had anonymous Anathapindikas who have helped us to expose the truth, but presently, we do not have a king Pasedena to punish those who abuse power and commit treacherous acts. However, we are still lucky, because people within the country and around the world have had a chance to be in touch with the truth, and the public opinions have been on our side to speak against the unethical people. Pasedena of today is the national and international opinions. These people cannot hide their lowly behaviors and actions. They hired gangsters and had them disguise as Buddhist followers, to put up banners across the Buddha’s altar, to destroy, to assault, to provoke, hoping that you would react with violence so that they had the reason to arrest you and convict you. Thanks to your non-violent behaviors, these government officials failed completely. What kind of Buddhist followers that would assault and belittle the monastics, wear shoes into the Buddha Hall, hang banners right in front of the Buddha statue, call the monks as “Comrades, why don’t you go home to live near your mother, your father, and your wives?” The monks left their homes to be ordained, how could they have wives! Such pity is to those who were hired to be in the mob. They were paid with only 200.000 dong a day and they were directed by the police and the National Front with signs and whistles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is I could never imagine that the officials of a government would apply these unethical behaviors. Where is the money they use to hire mobs? Is it tax money from the people, used for their salary and for unwholesome activities like that? Why do they disguise to be Buddhist practitioners to destroy Buddhist practitioners, disguise to be the people to lie to and to oppress the people? Where is the revolutionary ethics? Why has the revolutionary ethics reached to such alarming bankruptcy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing up to this part, Thay see clearly the reason why the policy on cultural towns and villages are not successful. How can a policy be successful when it is executed by immoral officials? If these officials are corrupted, abusing power, and when their families are victims of social evils, then how can they succeed in guiding and building cultural towns and villages? If the Ngo Dinh Diem regime (1963) failed with their policy “Gathering farmers into controlled hamlets,” then the present government also did not succeed with the policy “cultural towns and villages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder who decided to use the term culture instead of ethics. An ideology that judges religion, believing that religion is the drug heroine, and then it would not be comfortable to use the term ethics. Then why did we talk about revolutionary ethics in the beginning of the revolution? Perhaps because the revolutionary ethics became corrupted, so the term ethics could not carry much anymore. The term culture can go in tandem with civilization. It does not carry the notion of morality and ethics. Why don’t we use the term traditional ethics standard? In the past, our ancestors were able to build a healthy ethical way of life, with the contribution of the three spiritual paths which were Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. Is depending on tradition going against with new ideology? The most beautiful thing of Buddhism is the spirit of inclusiveness, not caught in dogmas and views and not in the need to eliminate other traditions. That is the meaning of “Inclusiveness,” as in the four immeasurable minds loving kindness, compassion, joy and inclusiveness. Inclusiveness (Upeksa) is non-discrimination and all-embracing. Buddhism in the past helped foster harmony in all spiritual traditions, so that the three traditions Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism could stand together to build the country. During Thay’s return in 2005, at a talk given at the National Institute of Political Studies in Saigon, someone in the audience asked: If we take refuge in the Three Jewels [the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha], do we have the right to love the Party and the Nation? The question was simple but it was able to reflect the worries and hesitation of those people who wanted to return to the spiritual path that their ancestors had worked hard to develop, but they still did not dare to. Thay answered with a different question: If we take refuge and lose our freedom, not being able to love what we want to love, then why would we take refuge? The enthusiastic hand clapping resounded in the auditorium. Once we take refuge, we will love the country and the Party better and more appropriately. Our country and nation have been taught by Buddhism and enjoyed much happiness brought from the spirit of inclusiveness. Why can’t we return to our source? Why are people afraid of the spirit of inclusiveness? Why can’t people see that if we think in the direction of non-duality, openness and inclusiveness, humanity will be able to save so much flesh, blood and tear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2069&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;307&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/tu-hieu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Tu Hieu Monastery - Vietnam[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With certainty, the uncle policemen will find and read these words I write to you. This is also very good, since Thay trusts that everyone has the Buddha nature, which means the seed of understanding, compassion and loving kindness. It is of great merit to water these seeds. Many uncle policemen have been transformed by you. What if these words I am writing find their way to the eyes of those in the Central Party, those in the Central Committee for (Politburo) Making Policy of the Party (Ban Tuyên Giáo), in the high levels of the government? I think they will raise their eyebrows; they will say that these are unskillful behaviors of the ones carrying out the policy and that it is the one worm who spoils the pot of soup. But the truth is that they allowed their people to do that and then to report untruthfully and pull them along. Then they cannot blame the responsibility on others. The scholars and humanists in the country suggested that the government conducted an open investigation to bring light to the situation. The wrong doings committed in the past years – the corruptions, power abuse, trickery and treachery – must be brought to light and there must be fair punishment, so that the people in the country may again have confidence in the government system, and so that the government may continue to “govern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first trip back to our country in 2005, after 39 years of living oversea, I practiced wholeheartedly to listen to all different groups and had a relatively accurate understanding of the situation. I said: During this visit, I only have one message, which is there is nothing more valuable and noble than brotherhood and sisterhood. We can say that the most inspiring moment of the trip took place at our root temple Tu Hieu – the day that all monks and nuns from both sides of State sanctioned Buddhist Church and non-state sanctioned Monastic Sangha (Tăng Đoàn) came together to recite their precepts, after having been divided for over ten years. I remember very clearly that after the Dharma talk at Tu Dam Temple, I informed the news that both sides Buddhist Church and non-state sanctioned Monastic Sangha (Tăng Đoàn) will gather in the Root Temple to recite the Pratimoksha precepts together, and everyone cried out of happiness. The points that I suggested afterwards to the government concerning separating politics from religion, etc., they did not originate from me, but from other Venerable monks in the State sanctioned Buddhist Church. I listened to the high monks, and I acknowledged their views and aspirations. They could not speak up, so I spoke up for them, and that was all. If I met difficulties because I dared to speak up, it was because of brotherhood. Similarly, I also spoke up about the situation of Tibet. We are a nation that suffered numerous times because of the invasion from the North. Now another nation has fallen into that situation, how can we have the heart not to say anything? I spoke up for a nation, to voice a truth, knowing that it may bring difficulties, but I still had to speak up. That is conscience. That is brotherhood. Many venerable wanted to protect my Bat Nha children. They tried to raise their voice many times, even proposing to sponsor you so that you had the legal right to practice, but because the Buddhist Church did not truly have the true power of the church, so those proposals were rejected by the governmental police and Religious Affairs Committee. Our country does not yet have true religious freedom, and the government is controlling tightly the Buddhist Church machinery, and the Buddhist Church is helpless, not able to protect their own children. This is a truth clearly seen by everyone. How can it be hidden?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police, the local government and the Religious Affairs Committee, via their actions and documents, were and are doing things against the laws of the country, the Constitution as well as the Legislation of the Religions. Therefore, we have the responsibility to help the nation, the Executive Branch and the Legislation Branch to see the wrong doings that are causing serious damages to our country and in the hearts of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am not pessimistic. I trust that the situation will change. The reason is that you are present there. The Vietnamese youth have begun to see the truth and to know what they are hoping for their motherland. The Vietnamese young people, whether they are studying within the country or overseas, are able to realize that Vietnam need more democracy, more citizen rights and more human rights; only then our people may have the opportunity to contribute to our country and bring our country to an upward direction. In this time period, a country cannot shut itself out of the rest of the world. It has to open doors and co-operate with other nations. And it has to obey international laws, including respecting human rights. My Bat Nha children have chosen the path of non-violent struggle, and you have invested all of your faith to do that. Your non-hating hearts, your fraternal heart have touched people deeply. Not only the Buddhists inside and outside of the country are supporting you, but people in other circles are also supporting you. You are not alone on your path. Even though the path is difficult, it is very beautiful. I am very happy to see that I have been continued by you. Amongst us, there are those who are still very young, but our hearts are always gentle and pure. We go as a river. We learn as we go, and we will also be continued by the generations following behind us. We have a path – a very bright path that our ancestors had discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read very carefully all of the letters you sent to me. Sister Don Nghiem said: “Bat Nha of yesterday has become rain, falling onto the ground, sprouting the Bodhi seed (of Understanding and Love).” Sister Ao Nghiem said: “On our path, I have found brothers and sisters with the same aspiration. Regardless of what may happen to me, I will not feel ashamed to my ancestors and friends in the five continents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day the Venerables in Lam Dong province came to recite their precepts at Phuoc Hue Temple, they all cried because they felt so moved for your difficult situation, and all of you had a chance to cry with them. That moment was very beautiful. That was a Dharma rain. History recorded that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2068&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;147&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sr-don-nghiem.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Sr. Don Nghiem[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sister Don Nghiem is one of the White Lotuses Family, barely eighteen years old. The letter she sent to me had the value of an insight gatha, and she herself did not even know it. Bat Nha to her is the months and years of happiness, because there, she was able to live in her aspiration and in brotherhood and sisterhood. Bat Nha is also the streams of tear, rolling down during the days of attack and destruction. Bat Nha has become a legend, a fairy tale, but Bat Nha is not lost, it has only become rain. The Bat Nha rain has fallen to the ground and sprouted the seed of Bodhi, the seed of Understanding and Love in Sister Don Nghiem’s heart, in your hearts and in the hearts of many other young people. These are the indestructible Diamond seeds. No fire may burn it. Bat Nha will be reborn again in new forms, because its Bodhi seed is present everywhere. One must be able to see Bat Nha in its signless forms and its multi-forms. Sister Don Nghiem has been able to see it, so she is not suffering and worried anymore. Bat Nha of Sister Don Nghiem will be everlasting. With that insight, people like Sister Don Nghiem will never step back or give up. Therefore, Thay is never pessimistic. Thay trusts in the youth of Vietnam. Thay does not need to advise you to do this and that. Right within your own situation and that of the country, you yourself know what you need to do, and with certainty, you will accomplish your aspiration. This is because your Mind of Understanding and Love is present. Therefore, Thay has trust and confidence in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 6th, 2009, from Plum Village via the internet, I had the opportunity to give a talk to the Religion Summit Conference in Melbourne, Australia. I shared with religious leaders who were present at the conference about the Buddhist vision on the global spiritual ethics. I talked about the newly revised Five Mindfulness Trainings as the path humanity may apply in order to exit the difficult situation, saving our planet earth and bringing peace and happiness to the world. The revised Five Mindfulness Trainings are the fruit of practice of the Sangha over eight months. It is the path founded by the Buddha. It is the Buddhist contribution to humanity, extremely necessary in this globalization period. We have a path, we have the confidence, we have each other as a Sangha, and thus we do not need to worry anymore. Just as young Brother Phap Dai said: “We know that besides our practice, we do not need to worry about anything else. We vow to practice better, so that we do not disappoint our Teacher and Ancestors.” Hearing you say things like that, I know that I have faith in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Bat Nha Thay (as some of you have called me!)
Nhất Hạnh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blue Cliff Monastery&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October 21, 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2047&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/rekindling-300x225.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Be-in, Phuoc Hue - Vietnam[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, in the Great Harmony Meditation Hall of Blue Cliff Monastery, there was an ordination ceremony for two young people, one who had already graduated from Dental School and the other, from Business School. They are sisters Chan Lan Nghiem (True Adornment of Love) and Chan Manh Nghiem (True Adornment of Beginning, i.e. in Beginner’s Mind). These two sisters had the opportunity to learn the precepts and mindful manners from Thay for a whole week before the ordination date. They have been accepted as permanent residents in the White Crane Hamlet at Blue Cliff Monastery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Thay shaved these young sisters’ heads, he prayed for them wholeheartedly that they could keep their beginner’s mind for their entire monastic life. If one is able to keep one’s beginner’s mind, with certainty one will succeed. There are those who practice successfully, and there are those who do not. If the monastics do not know the way to practice, then they can lose their integrity as they receive the respect and offerings from the lay people. Therefore, every time when there is a group of young people being ordained, the first advice that Thay gives them is to be very careful with the respect and offerings from the lay practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting on the monastic robe, we become the symbol of the Three Jewels which are the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha. We represent the Sangha Jewel. In the Sangha Jewel, there is the Dharma Jewel and the Buddha Jewel. For this reason, when lay practitioners see a monastic, they want to express this reverence through making offerings and prostrating before that monastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How should a newly ordained monk or nun practice when someone comes to prostrate before him or her? We have the tendency to think, “Please do not prostrate before me, because I am just recently ordained, I do not have any merits or virtues for you to show reverence to.” When we refuse like that, this lay practitioner loses an opportunity to express his/her reverence for the Three Jewels. Therefore, instead, we should sit very still, following our breath and contemplating, “This person is expressing his/her reverence to the Three Jewels, not to my ego. I must sit still so that this person may touch the earth. He/he prostrates to the Three Jewels and not to me.” Practicing like so, we will be safe and our humility will be protected. If not, we will be corrupted. We become corrupted because we have the perception that we are the object of the reverence. It is like the national flag – it is only a piece of cloth. In saluting the flag, people are saluting a country, not a piece of cloth. If that piece of cloth thinks that it is the object of the salutation, then it is mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay, himself, does not like to let people prostrate or touch the earth before him. But Thay has to practice sitting there so that people may touch the earth. Touching the earth is an important practice for the lay practitioners, therefore, we should sit with mindfulness and represent the Three Jewels. If we can practice like that, the person touching the earth may nourish his/her reverence for the Three Jewels, and in turn, we nourish our humility. If we do not practice, then we become victims of the respect, and our monastic life will be jeopardized.
Your Grandfather Monk, Patriarch Thanh Quy, had great humility. His nature was also disliking people prostrating to him, but because he was a teacher, Grandfather Monk allowed them to do so. When the Venerable Chi Niem built the stupa for Grandfather Monk, Grandfather Monk instructed him to place on the tip of the stupa a statue of the Buddha. Later when people came to touch the earth, Grandfather Monk’s intention was for them to be expressing their reverence towards the Buddha, and not towards Grandfather Monk. Everyone knows about this story at our ancestral temple Tu Hieu. We, teacher and student, must learn this humble attitude from the Patriarch Thanh Quy. This practice of humility will help us maintain forever our sense of who we are. We can see that in both the Northern and Southern traditions, there are monastics who become corrupted because they lack this practice. They see people prostrating to them and think that these people are admiring their egos. Meanwhile, everyone knows that the self (the ego) is the most offensive obstacle. In the Buddhist tradition, the self is only an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we touch the earth, we have the opportunity to let go of the illusion of the self. With the five points of our bodies on the ground (two knees, two elbows, and forehead), we open wide upward, our two palms. We contemplate, “Respected World Honored One, respected spiritual and blood ancestors, I have nothing to be proud of. Whatever that I have – my little bit of talent and intelligence – they have all been transmitted to me from you, the Buddha and my ancestors. I am only your continuation.” Looking deeply in this way, we feel that in our being there is a lot of space and freedom, and we can release the complex, (the idea) of superiority. If we have an inferior complex, we also contemplate like that: “Respected World Honored One, respected spiritual and blood ancestors, I have certain weaknesses and shortcomings. They are also not mine, but they have been transmitted to me. As your continuation, I vow to practice to transform these weaknesses in me and to fulfill your expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A monastic life must be both modest and simple. The ten novice precepts that we receive the day we enter the monastic community are beautiful Dharma precepts. The sixth precept is on not using cosmetics or wearing jewelry, the seventh precept is on not being caught in worldly amusements, and the eighth precept is on not living a life of material luxury. “Aware that a monk or nun who lives with too much comfort or luxury becomes prone to sensual desire and pride, I vow to live my whole life simply, with few desires. I resolve not to sit on luxurious chairs or lie down on luxurious beds, not to wear silk or embroidered fabrics, not to live in luxurious quarters, and not to travel using luxurious means of transport.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of a monastic is made of the humble virtue and the simple life. Therefore, upon receiving offerings, the monastics do not keep it for themselves, but turn the offerings to the Sangha, the monastic community. These offerings are only for those who are in real need. The monastic life has to be “insufficient in the three basic needs.” This means that in meeting our needs for food, clothing and shelter; none of these three needs should be met too sufficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this practice to be correct, we have to lack a little bit. For example, when we eat, we should not eat until we are too full. When we dress, we should not dress too comfortably, let alone too beautifully. When we stay in a place, it should not be too comfortable, let alone too luxurious. With these standards, one can determine who are the true practitioners, and who are not. Putting on the monastic robe, we have the dignity to receive respect and offerings. If we do not practice, we will abuse that reverence and offerings and lose our Dharma body. The Dharma body is the true spiritual life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2048&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/blue-cliff-monastery-300x199.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Blue Cliff Monastery, New York[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay is fortunate that even at this age, Thay still feels embarrassed when a lay practitioner makes an offering to Thay. As you may already know, Thay also lives simply like you, and every time someone makes an offering to Thay, Thay never keeps it to himself. In all our monasteries, we have the Understanding and Love Program (a relief program), and we always reduce our consumption in order to share our material resources with those in need – the orphans, the destitute elderly, the poor children without education and proper nutrition, and victims of poverty, diseases and natural disasters. We nourish our compassion and loving kindness through these helping programs. And there are so many monastic and lay brothers and sisters who have been helping us wholeheartedly in this work. This is one of the great happiness of the monastics. It is the practice of the second precept: sharing time, energy and material resources with those in real needs. The essence of our happiness is derived from our deep aspiration and our brotherhood and sisterhood; and not from our consuming. Young people come to us in great numbers because they are able to touch this happiness. By joining our community, they can practice letting go of their attachments and suffering, and they are able to taste the happiness brought about by a deep aspiration and from true brotherhood and sisterhood. Both sisters that ordained yesterday came from rich families. They were well-educated and had more than enough conditions to live a materialistically filled and luxurious life. But they have renounced everything so that they could ordain. Their eyes sparkled when they received the novice precepts. This proved that they have great happiness, and this happiness is made of the substance of deep aspiration and brotherhood and sisterhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay recognizes that a revolutionist also has an aspiration similar to the aspiration of a monastic. Prince Siddhartha Gautama’s action of leaving his throne to become a monk was also a revolutionary action. We can let go of worldly attachments because we have great aspirations. The revolutionist must also have great aspirations; if not, he/she will not be able to let go of the material life and to follow the path of service of his/her country. And like the monastics, the revolutionary must live a simple life, not weighed down by fame and benefits. A true revolutionary also lives a simple life like a monastic and his/her happiness is similar to that of a monastic’s. This means that the substance of this happiness is a deep aspiration and a sense of comradeship. “Your shirt sleeves torned to the shoulder; and my pants ragged with two patches. Still, we smile; even with our feet, frigid without shoes. Loving each other, we hold each other’s hand” (from a revolutionary song). In this spirit, a police officer is also a revolutionary. The police officer can also live happily with his revolutionary ideal and his comradeship like the monastics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of those who received the Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings in the United States, there was a Captain in the police force, named Cheri Maples. She practiced very well according to the Plum Village tradition. In the beginning, she received the Five Mindfulness Trainings, then after many years, she received the Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings, and in 2008, she received the lamp transmission to be a lay Dharma Teacher. In fact, Cheri Maples had already performed outstandingly her responsibility as a Dharma Teacher over the last ten years. She transmitted the practice to those who had the responsibility of keeping the peace in society – the police officers, the attorneys, the judges, and those in the Department of Corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheri Maples had been in the police force for 20 years, and she was in charge of all the hiring, firing, and training of new and current officers. Of those 20 years, Cheri Maples practiced in the Plum Village tradition for 14 years. This practice helped Cheri transform a lot, and it helped her succeed enormously in the training, distributing and assigning the police officers. Because of this great success, she was invited to work in a high position in the Department of Corrections and in the Department of Justice. In these positions, Cheri trained over 1500 people, including police officers, attorneys, judges, and state officials in the techniques she learned from Plum Village. Currently, Cheri is implementing these practices to help those who work in prisons, as well as the prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Cheri organized a retreat in Madison, Wisconsin for over 650 people, mostly police officers and other criminal justice professionals. Thay and the Plum Village Sangha were invited to come lead this retreat. In this retreat, there was no incense offering, chanting or ceremony. There was only the practice of calming and transforming our body and mind, the practice of reviving and nourishing the substance of our deepest aspiration and brotherhood/sisterhood, and the practice of bringing a spiritual dimension into our professional life so that we can be more successful in our profession and have more joy in our daily life. This retreat was very successful. My children, just imagine very stocky and built American police officers doing walking meditation with gentle and free steps, sitting in meditation with calm breaths, listening deeply and speaking lovingly with a stable sitting posture. The life of the police officers and those who work in the Department of Justice is often full of stress and suffering. Do you know that each year in the U.S., there are about 300 police officers who commit suicide with their own guns? This, they refer to as “eating their own guns.” The number of police officers committing suicide with their own guns is twice as many as the number of police officers being shot by gangsters and criminals. The prison guards are so full of stress, because they have to confront frequently the energy of violence in the prison and in themselves. Statistically, after 20 years of serving in this field, most prison guards only have an average life span of 58 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly those policemen and guards who came to Bat Nha and caused difficulties to Thay’s Bat Nha children also had a lot of tension and suffering in them. They are government officials and they have to obey the orders from their superiors, and many times, they are forced to do things that they feel torned in their minds and bodies. When Thay’s baby monks wrote the letter to the policemen, you were able to see this, and Thay silently praised you when Thay read that letter. The police officer’s salary is not enough to live by; Thay is aware of that, and a number of police officers have to use their power and position to get more money and, as a result, they gradually lose their aspiration to serve their country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheri Maples said that in 1984, when she joined the police force, her deepest aspiration was to work for peace and to end violence and injustice. That was the substance of aspiration. Cheri wrote in the foreword to one of Thay’s book: “I quickly became intimately familiar, on a nightly basis, with the suffering caused by poverty, racism, social injustice, stealing, sexual abuse, domestic abuse, unmindful consumption, and oppression. I deeply craved peace, but I did not understand that peace began in my own heart. I felt overwhelmed by the suffering that I witnessed, caused by public misunderstanding, and by the politics of my own department. This misplaced anger of others fanned my own impatience and anger. I began to do my job in a mechanical way. I consumed too much alcohol, and I became angry and depressed. As a result, I brought suffering into the relationships with my family and others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2049&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/uh-lotuses-300x201.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Plum Village France[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being in touch with the Plum Village practice, she learned that she could carry a gun with mindfulness. Cheri began to transform and was able to revive her deep aspiration. In the end, Cheri was able to serve her country and her people very deeply. Cheri’s happiness increased greatly thanks to her practice. When she learned that you had been evicted from Bat Nha and under strict surveillance at Phuoc Hue Temple, she wrote a letter to the President and to the Minister of National Public Security Department of Vietnam to ask them to intervene, so that you may safely return to your practice in the place you were ordained. Cheri sent Thay a copy of that letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Cheri practiced successfully and was able to rekindle her aspiration to serve her country, to find joy in her life of service, due to her diligent spiritual practice. Then is it not true, my children, that our police officers can do the same as well, especially when we know that many of these officers and policemen are from Buddhist families. In the letter sent to the President and the Minister of National Public Security Department, Cheri shared her hope that in the future, there will be retreats for government officers in Vietnam like the one organized in Wisconsin, and that there is a possibility that police officers and other government officials from the United States can come to Vietnam to practice together with the police officers and other government officials in Vietnam. The retreat in Wisconsin was a great success, although it was not an easy retreat. In the beginning, the suffering and prejudices were severe, but they were gradually transformed in the retreat. The theme of the retreat was “Keeping the Peace.” This theme makes Thay remember a children’s song in the North, “Uncle policeman, we love you very much. With the guns on your shoulders, you keep the peace.” The mindfulness practices provided at the retreat had an extremely positive effect on both the police officers and the community. Cheri wrote in her letter: “As a result of Thich Nhat Hanh’s teachings, I believe our department was transformed – from being police officers dependent on our authority to being peace officers dependent on our relationships with the people in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retreats organized for police officers, for congress people as well as for government officials were held in a non-sectarian spirit. There were no devotional and ceremonial practices as in other retreats, because according to the laws of the Western democratic countries, religion and the state cannot be mixed. Thay and the Sangha respected that principle, so during those retreats, we did not have the intention to convert the retreatants into Buddhists. We only wanted to help these practitioners to transform their suffering and internal difficulties and to rediscover faith in their ideals and their brotherhood/sisterhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies in our Buddhist Institutes are more theoretical than practical. These practices need to be implemented into the basic, intermediate and high levels of the Buddhist Institutes, so that Buddhism can truly be applicable in daily life. Only with these practices, a practitioner may recover and maintain stably his/her monastic aspiration and not to be caught by fame and profits. This practice is also beneficial to People’s Public Security intermediate schools, People’s Police Universities and People’s Institutes of Security. It can be taught as part of the curriculum and practiced without the appearance of religion, just like during the retreat in Wisconsin. Thay suggests that the head of the Department of Security International Cooperation may like to discuss with Dharma Teacher Cheri Maples in more detail about this proposal. It is possible that our Dharma teachers can also contribute to the teachings and practices at these training centers for policemen and other government officials. When we can benefit our country and its people, then even if we are accused of being communists, it is okay as long as the work helps people suffer less. If the policemen suffer, then the people will also suffer. When the police officers have internal suffering and they cannot resolve it, then their pain will be released onto their families and to the people. When police officers are corrupt and abuse their power, then not only is this a pity for the police officers and for the government, but also especially, a pity for the people. We should educate in such a way that the policies of the Departments can respond to the real needs of the people, then that education is truly beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My children, in history, every so often there is a great spiritual teacher who appears to purify and renew the Buddhist tradition. Those such as Nagarjuna, Deva, Asanga, Vasubhandu, Tran Na, Tzuantzan, the Sixth Patriarch Hui Neng, Linchi, Tri Gia, and Tang Hoi, were all revolutionaries who had the capacity to rejuvenate Buddhism, so that it can serve more effectively the new social situations. Great Teacher T’ai-hsu in the 30’s of the last century called for “Revolution in the teachings! Revolution in the precepts! Revolution in the properties!” Many people in the monastic circle in our country listened to this calling and worked hard to find ways to make Buddhism prosper. For Thay’s entire life, Thay has also tried to realize this calling. If there is no revolution of the teachings, it is difficult to apply the teachings into modern life. Therefore, from Engaged Buddhism we, in turn, have Applied Buddhism. If there is no revolution in the teachings, then the traditional precepts and mindful manners will not be able to confront the modern social crisis, the corruption and the social evils in our present society. That is why, now we have the revised Five Mindfulness Training, the revised Ten Novice Precepts, the Order of Interbeing, and the revised Pratimoksha. If there were no change in the teaching of handling property and possessions and we continue to be dependent on the offerings and donations of laypeople, then how can we have enough freedom to realize the revolution in the teachings and the precepts, and to contribute to work of purifying and building a society that is democratic and healthy. Without the revolution in the teachings, the precepts and in the monastic handling of property, then Buddhism will become decrepit, corrupted and lifeless and cannot continue to thrive or develop and will die out. A political organization is the same; if there is no revolutionary fire to nourish it, it will become decrepit and corrupted. It will go against its original aspirations, and the people who try to join the organization only do so because of benefits and not because of their ideals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2050&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2007VietnamThay-300x210.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Thich Nhat Hanh in Vietnam, 2007[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the trip to Vietnam in 2007, Thay had a chance to personally visit and observe many temples in Hanoi. In the Buddha hall, in Patriarchs’ hall, on the front yard, wherever there were statues of the Buddha, the Boddhisattvas, Arhats, Patriarchs, Dharma Protectors, and Holy Mother displayed, money offerings were stuffed in the hands of these statues. Thay had the feeling that those Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Arhats, Patriarchs, etc. all became people who received bribes. They became the deities who only protected those who bribed them. This image shows us that the spirit world reflects our human world; reflecting the belief that those who do not accept corruption will not succeed and can not accomplish much. Thay questioned whether it is true that Bat Nha could not continue because Bat Nha did not accept this rule. Some people say that when the water is too pure, the fish can not live. Is this truth the case here? No, Thay does not want to believe in that truth. We have plenty of honorable people, true practitioners in our country who have not been bought out by fame or money. And you, Thay’s children, have been following their steps, even though around you, there are many monastics who have lost their beginner’s mind and who are looking only for material and emotional comforts to satisfy their life – a life deprived of meaningful ideals and a sense of brotherhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the intellectual, humanitarian and political world, there are still people who have integrity and honesty; who would rather remain poor and than to loose their conscience. The father of our Elder Brother Phap Hoi was a very honest and upright cadre who was content with living modestly his entire life so as to nourish his integrity and virtue. Thanks to this, we now have Elder Brother Phap Hoi and so many others who, thanks to their faith in the traditional virtue of our country, are capable of maintaining integrity in their own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddha-dharma seeds, the seeds of mindfulness practice that have been sowed in the last few years are beginning to sprout. Exposed to the practice, exposed to Sangha, the good seeds of deep aspiration and of happiness that have been in the hearts of these young people are beginning to grow fresh. The young monastics along with the young lay people have begun to see a beautiful spiritual path that can open up a new horizon of brotherhood and of a deep desire to service humanity. The ‘Cheri Maples’ of Vietnam are beginning to appear. There have some public security officers and young policemen who have come to practice with us and are beginning to transform. You have had some opportunity to befriend some of these officers. One police officer had confided his realization to us that when one’s mind is restless, one can not help bring peace to society, and with a distressed mind, one will only make the situation worse. That was the realization that Cheri Maples had also discovered. The heart-breaking case at Bat Nha is evidence of this disturbance in the hearts of the people. Because of fear, of resentment, of wrong perception, those responsible for security have caused such public disorder and have disgraced the image of our nation to the international community. One of those ‘Cheri Maples’ of Vietnam have expressed her intention to be ordained as a nun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a few days ago, a young aspirant in Mountain Cloud Hamlet, named T.M.T wrote a letter that moved us and made us realize that the sacred fire of ideal and of brotherhood and sisterhood can be easily rekindled within young people’s souls. In her letter “Behind the Halo,” T.M.T. has shown her determination and willingness to release her constraints – the wealth, authority and influence – in order to ordain and live a simple and happy life with the deep aspiration of serving humanity and all of life. The whole family of T.M.T. was opposed to this and everybody considered her as being mad. What do you think of this, my children? If T.M.T was mad, then that madness is not different from the madness of Prince Siddhartha who renounced the throne to enter a monastic life. Who was Siddhartha? Siddhartha was a young man who had the determination to release everything and to search for a beautiful ideal. Siddhartha had the revolutionary fire in his heart, that provided him with enough energy to renounce his special privileges and comforts. Who is Siddhartha? Siddhartha is none other than T.M.T of today. We are the young people searching for this beautiful ideal. We are the continuation of Siddhartha. Siddhartha is there, present in our homeland so we can still have hope. Young people entering the monastic life have a very strong beginner’s mind, just like the young revolutionaries who also have a very strong beginner’s mind. We all have to maintain our beginner’s mind in order to succeed. With our beginner’s mind, we will not be weighed down by fame and wealth. Our beginner’s mind intact, we can still be free and liberated. The practice of the Buddha is to water the seeds of gratitude, of compassion, of wisdom and courage within us. The painful experience at Bat Nha has awakened the hearts of so many people inside and outside our homeland and has helped revive in them, the fire of ideal and the substance of courage. Poet Hoang Hung wrote in his article “Four Hundred Bat Nha Bells” that the petition letter he initiated calling for the protection of Bat Nha Sangha contained the signatures of well renowned people in the circle of Science, Literature and Art – people who “had never participated in any public expression against the government”. This means their seeds of compassion and courage were watered, so they did not hesitate to sign the petition letter. One of them confided, “In the past I was very afraid to get involve with such things, but this time if I did not raise my voice, it would be too cowardly and I would not be at ease with myself.” And of course after signing the letter, they were happy to know that they still had integrity in their hearts. The diligent practice of Thay’s Bat Nha children has watered the good seeds in people – Buddhist and non-Buddhist, inside the country and aboard, compatriots or foreigners. Those seeds are the seeds of faith, of love and of courage. The way of non-violence and of non-hatred of Thay’s children had evoked a trust towards a gentler humanism for the future, aroused a love in the people’s heart, and revived in everyone the virtue of non-fear that was already present it them. The Most Venerable monks have raised their voice. Buddhist novices have raised their voice. Students have raised their voice. Scholars and intellects have raised their voice. Small business people have raised their voice. Cadres and Party’s members have raised their voice. Friends from different religions have raised their voice. The world has raised their voice. Bat Nha, liked a fragrant lotus, has revived so much beautiful affection from the people. Our practice of “watering the good seeds” can bring about the harvest of love and happiness so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My beloved children, looking deeply, you will see that the people responsible for the disposal of the Bat Nha Sangha had acted contrary to what we practice. They only water the negative seeds. They threatened and lied in order to water the seed of fear in us. They said that Bat Nha Sangha is involved in politics. They said that the presence of Bat Nha Sangha is a threat to national security. They painted and foisted on the Bat Nha Sangha the word “reactionary.” A Major General from the Central Board of People’s Public Security Establishment was sent to confront the Bat Nha community as if you were a group of hostile reactionary. But on the contrary, you are but true practitioners that have no interest in politics and only want to practice in safety under the protection of the Buddhist Congregation and laws of the nation. They hired the poor and illiterate people, who were not Buddhist and knew nothing of Buddhist teachings, to do their work of attacking and expelling you out of the monastery. They lied to those people, saying that you were stealing the temple, you were the reactionary, you brought “snakes home to bite the chicken”, and you were a threat to national security. Essentially, they watered the seeds of misunderstanding, of suspicion and of hatred in the other compatriots. When these people lost their peace of mind, they were able to abuse, to destroy, to intrude on the monastery properties and to violate the human dignity of their own compatriots. How else can we have Buddhists who burn sutras, burn statues, throw excrements at the Venerables, tear at the monastics’ robes, drag monastics about like garbage bags and infringe on the monks’ private parts? Thay saw that their actions were very dangerous, and that those officials who hired such people, in the future, would become victims of those very same people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking more carefully, we can see that not only the Bat Nha Sangha was a victim of a wrong policy, but local authorities and local people were also victims of this policy. Young public security officers and other administrative officials had received orders to eliminate Bat Nha and to do everything to accomplish this task, even though the task was contrary to the moral principles. People say, for the Party, for the regime, for the national security, even reluctantly we must carry out those tasks. We suppress ourselves to believe that we are doing it for the benefits of people and the nation. But from the depth of our consciousness we know those deeds are unrighteous, contrary to morality. Our conscience is disturbed. Members in our family look at us with doubt and resentment. Our compatriots look at us with scorn, contempt and disgrace. The suffering of a government official with a low wage is relatively small, compared to the gnawing conscience and the resentment from family members and compatriots; those are the real sufferings. Loss of peace and of self respect is a great suffering. That is an enormous loss. In a war, there are always great losses – the number of people killed, the number of people injured and missing. In the battles like the one at Bat Nha, although no one died but the damages were tremendous. The damages were to our human dignity, our conscience, our ideal, to the love of our homeland and to our country’s portrayal in the international stage. We not only did not improve our country but disgraced it instead, when we were forced to carry on those unjustly battles. In the end, all of us – young monastics, government officials and public security officers – are the victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A policy that benefits our country and its people is always based on the foundation of correct view, that in Buddhism we call “right view.” If our mind is covered by greed and desire, fear and doubt, then we cannot have right view, and our view is distorted and not true to reality. This view is called wrong view. To view Bat Nha as a menace to national security is a huge erroneous view. It is hard to understand how such an absurd event like that could have occurred? Because of that wrong view, there is wrong thinking, that by all means, Bat Nha must be eliminated. Wrong thinking leads to wrong speech and wrong actions. To say that the Bat Nha situation is an internal dispute, that the government and public security officers did not interfere with Bat Nha, that Bat Nha is involved with politics, and so on – all those statements are not right speech but wrong speech. Next, there is a sort of erroneous action called wrong action. The destruction, the expulsion, the arrests and the violations of human dignity – all these actions bring about suffering to the community that we vow to serve and suffering to our own self. The root of this suffering can all be traced back to wrong view. Because of that wrong view, we have wrong policies that are harmful to the nation and its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2052&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;264&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thay-drinking-678x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Drink your tea![/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resurrect faith and vitality in the Buddhist community, the genuine spiritual practitioners, especially those who no longer hold positions in the Buddhist organizations, have to find ways to come together. Because of fear and suspicion, people have deliberately controlled the Buddhist organization. And the method of control used so far is to infiltrate the organizations with their people so they can manipulate and control. Only a corrupted Buddhist dignitary could be manipulated. But if a dignitary is full of integrity, then they can not manipulate him. The infiltration into Buddhist organization with such corrupt people damages the organization. There were documents issued by the organization with a language that was not the true language of the Buddhist tradition. Everyone knows that those documents have been prepared in advance for the Buddhist dignitaries to sign. With such corruption, how can the Buddhist organization truly contribute as leader? If a religious organization was controlled to the point that it is paralyzed and does not dare to raise its voice to protect its children, then that organization no longer has enough trusted power, enough standing to lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Thay thinks that the genuine senior practitioners should come together and raise their voice to lead the young generation of Buddhists and to transmit the necessary energy to the Buddhist organization so that this organization will have the opportunity to wake up and progress forward. This is also true for a revolutionary organization. The worthy senior revolutionaries must also come together and raise their voice. Raise their voice to lead the young generation, to arouse the trust in them and to help rekindle the sacred fire of the revolution that is dying in its own organization. To do whatever we can so that those joining the revolutionary organization have ideals, have enthusiasm of the youth, and have the capacity to let go of power and fame. Otherwise, the organization will only attract elements of opportunism who enter the organization with the only goal of seeking prestige and power. Such an organization is no longer a revolutionary organization, especially when its senior members, caught in positions and power, live an extravagant and luxurious life, possessing huge accounts of money hidden in foreign banks. Deprived of the revolutionary fire in their hearts, how can they call themselves comrades without feeling ashamed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because they wanted to disband Bat Nha, they fabricated stories stating that the monastics at Bat Nha are involved in politics, oppose the regime, oppose the congregation, and that Bat Nha must be dealt with as if it were a reactionary organization. “Pure water that one wants to stir into a paste” (A saying that means, the truth cannot be smeared into falsehood no matter how much one tries.) The letter of aspirant T.M.T has a sentence, “…to kill a dog, people must say it is a mad dog.” This is a law that has existed for thousands years and only idiots do not understand it. Why do you want to align with Bat Nha? That path leads to the door of death. If people want to destroy it, it will be destroyed; sooner or later, it is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But certainly, Thay’s children have found that this Bat Nha case has become a special case. Because of your conduct, because of your pure drops of tears of non-violence and of non-hatred that everybody in the world has realized that it is not a mad dog or a crazy dog, and that maybe people would and could never kill this Bat Nha dog. Our neighbors, domestic and foreign, have seen that this is a smart dog and that we have to save its life because a smart dog can guard our doors and homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dear children, please remember to breathe gently and deeply for Thay and walk mindfully and peacefully for Thay. And in whatever circumstance, we shall practice to treat each day wholeheartedly. We need to practice to live genuinely and to see things with the eyes of compassion. Today is the substance that builds tomorrow. Therefore, we have to live beautifully today. Thay has great trust and confidence in you. The healing energy of the Three Jewels are protecting all of us. You should diligently practice the gatha verse on “Taking Refuge in One’s Island.” Do not seek any other refuge besides the island within. These were the reminding words of the World Honored One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in Plum Village, Thay will have the opportunity to continue to write you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your teacher,
Nhất Hạnh&lt;/p&gt;

It’s you who renews life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in these times when pain does rise
And I self-criticize, demoralize, over-analyze
Angel spirits wise help to turn my eyes
From looking inside to the skies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The sun still shines,” they remind
Even when it resides behind clouds and hides
And each day tides are pulled by the moon
And tonight the moon is full and bright
My gaze is on its light reflecting on snow so white
Fallen from an atmospheric height,
An ancient sacred rite of water, wind and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Chorus)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all I know is to walk out below
The stars and show
The ancestors who flow through me
That I can be free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for fathers and mothers,
Thank you for sisters and brothers,
For sons and for daughters
For the earth and the waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for bright days and dark nights,
For death and for new life.
Each breath we renew life
It’s you who renews life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way haw, way haw, way haw&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miigwetch G’chi Manidou
(Ojibway/Anishnaabe: “Thank You Great Spirit”)&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Bat Nha: Magical Sound of the Sitar&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2038&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/blue-cliff-300x198.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Blue Cliff Monastery[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay is continuing to write a letter to you from the hermitage Thach Lang in Blue Cliff Monastery. It is October 13th, 2009. Thay just came back from New York. In New York, Thay and the Sangha guided two days of practice for over 2000 American practitioners in the Northeast. It took place in the Beacon Theatre on Broadway Street, and the topic for the two practice days was “Building a Peaceful and Compassionate Society.” At 12:30 p.m. on October 10th, 2009, over 2000 people did walking meditation on Broadway to send energy to Thay’s “Bat Nha Children” who are residing in Phuoc Hue temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay recalls that during his stay in Phuoc Hue, Thay lived with two monastic brothers – Thay Tam Cat and Thay Duc Tram, who were also around Thay’s age. Back in the 1940’s, the three of us had studied together at the Buddhist Institute Bao Quoc in Hue. Thay Tam Cat’s lay name was Huyen Ton Vien Lau. Thay Duc Tram was one of the elder disciples of the Most Venerable Tri Thu at Paramita Temple. The three of us lived in Phuoc Hue and guided lay friends in their practice. Every early evening, we went out to a large field behind the temple to play soccer. Back then, no one in the monastic circle knew how to play soccer. The Most Venerable Thien Minh (Thay Tri Nghiem) was young back then, about 25 years old and was the first monk to play soccer together with the novices in Linh Son Temple in Da Lat. After a few years, other monks such as Thay Nhu Tram, Tri Khong, Long Nguyet and a number of other monastic students from the Buddhist Institute An Quang also came to Phuoc Hue to study and practice with Thay. At Phuoc Hue Temple, Thay also organized middle school and high school classes for children in the village. Your eldest brother, Nhat Tri, was ordained in this temple. On that same day, another child’s head was shaven and he received three precepts (equivalent to the first, second, and fourth of the Five Mindfulness Trainings). He only received the three precepts because he was too young – only six or seven years old. This little boy later became the Most Venerable Nguyen Hanh, who is now the Abbot of Viet Nam Temple in Houston, which is one of the largest temples in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your eldest brother Nhat Tri’s handwriting was exactly like Thay’s; just like your elder sister Luong Nghiem, when she writes calligraphy, her writing also looks a lot like that of Thay. Your brother Nhat Tri was one of the pioneers in the Youth and Social Service movement. He helped build the first two Villages of Love in this movement – Cau Kinh and Thao Dien villages. It was the Most Venerable Chau Duc who brought your elder brother from Quang Nam to entrust him in Thay’s care. The students in those middle school and high school classes of Bao Loc District are now in their sixties and seventies; most have become grandfathers or grandmothers. Smile my children. You are still very young so learn to live deeply in the present moment and smile the fresh and sincere smiles and to look with the eyes that are gentle and bright. Learn to love and forgive right in the present moment and to generate moments of happiness with the practice of mindfulness so that you will not become the aged venerables too soon. Your Grandfather Monk, the patriarch Thanh Quy Chan That, was able to maintain his innocence and pure mind until he was 80 years old that is because he was able to keep his Beginner’s Mind whole. Your Uncle Monk Chi Mau recounted that at Grandfather Monk’s last passing moment, he laid in the lion pose with his two hands joined into a lotus. We too – as teacher and disciples – aspire to practice like Grandfather Monk, maintaining our aspiration and our Beginner’s Mind in tact for our entire life. The energy of the Beginner’s Mind brings us and our loved ones a lot of happiness. The Beginner’s Mind is the most valuable nutriment to a spiritual practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2040&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ustour-300x225.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; US Tour[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this North American tour, when teaching about the Four Nutriments, Thay addressed volition first, as a kind of food, then consciousness, then sense impressions, and then edible foods. This teaching approach was used by Thay first during the tour at the monastic retreat in Deer Park Monastery. Thay hopes that all of you everywhere will have the chance to listen to the three Dharma talks during that monastic retreat. The Beginner’s Mind is also called Bodhicitta or the Mind of Love, which is the essential nutriment for us all. It belongs to the first source of nutriment – volition. Generally in society, people refer to it as the ideal, the aspiration, or the deepest wish of a person’s life. With that ideal of love in mind, instantly we have a great source of energy that helps us progress forward, overcoming all obstacles, realizing our deepest desires and attaining great happiness. A person without an ideal or an aspiration is someone without a life source. For monastic practitioners, that ideal is to transform our own suffering and to help others transform as well. We have come together because of that ideal and not because we seek fame, power or sensual pleasures. Because we know that the desire for fame, power and sensual pleasures can bring a lot of danger and suffering to our body and mind, we are determined to free ourselves from these desires and to find a more wholesome desire – the that desire is our Mind of Love. The Mind of Love is very strong when it first inhabits us. It helps us to break and release all our bondages more easily. During our entire life as practitioners, we should know how to nourish that Mind and to not allow it to erode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we must have a second source of nutriment – consciousness – which is the collective consciousness of the Sangha. The Sangha is a community of people with the same aspiration. Everyone in the Sangha has the energy of the Mind of Love; everyone wants to practice in order to transform ourselves and to contribute to the career of serving humanity. While living harmoniously together in accordance to one of the Six Harmonies, the Sangha is able to generate the collective energy of Mindfulness, Concentration, and Insight. It is this energy that helps nourish the Mind of Love in each member of the Sangha. If you, my disciples love the Sangha, do not want to be separated from the Sangha, and want to find ways to build the Sangha, it is because you have the need to be nourished by this collective energy. Therefore, when they try to disband the Sangha, you have made every effort to protect the Sangha and not to allow the Sangha to be separated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In society, the revolutionaries also have their Mind of Love. They have their ideal, their aspiration to save their homeland, their people; to push back the invaders and to struggle for their country’s independence. The will of the revolutionaries is not any less impressive than the monastic’s Mind of Love. And these revolutionaries also need a Sangha to nourish their aspiration, and that Sangha is their revolutionary organization. If in the Sangha we have the love of brotherhood and sisterhood, then in the revolutionary organization there is the love of comradeship. This love of comradeship is the source of food, of motivation that can nourish the willpower and endeavor of the revolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a revolutionary organization requires revolutionary ethics: integrity and honesty are the two basic virtues of a revolutionary organization; just like in the monastic precepts where concentration and insight are the true essence of a Sangha. If we do not practice the precepts and mindful manners and nor practice mindfulness, we cannot nourish the Sangha energy. If the revolutionary does not practice integrity and honesty, then he/she cannot nourish the revolutionary organization; and the fire of the revolution will extinguish. This rule holds true for the Sangha as well. Without the practice of living harmoniously together with the energy of mindfulness, concentration and insight, the Sangha will also be lifeless. Outwardly, it looks like a community of practice, but inwardly, it is only composed of individuals who are looking for material and emotional comforts to satisfy a meaningless life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddhist Church is the Sangha of all the Sanghas. If the Buddhist Church is made of Sanghas with life-force and with ideals born from the Mind of Love, the energy of the Buddhist Church will be powerful and the Buddhist Church will become a source of nourishment for both the monastic and lay practitioners. If not, then the Buddhist Church will only be a place where people come to seek profits and status. If the sacred fire of the revolution has extinguished, then the political establishment no longer has any life-force, and those people who want to join are no longer those filled with the ideal and aspiration to save the country and its people anymore; but are merely people looking for positions and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Catholic priests of the “Dòng Chúa Cứu Thế” spoke up to protect the Bat Nha Sangha, Thay saw that this practice tradition is still able to maintain the life of their community, therefore, they had enough heroic strength to speak up like that. When the Management Board of the Buddhist Church of Lam Dong Province spoke up to offer refuge and to protect the Bat Nha Sangha, Thay saw that the Management Board is still able to maintain the life of their Sangha, therefore they had enough courage and love to do so. If these Venerables spoke up to shelter and protect you, it was because the Bat Nha Sangha is still a Sangha nourished by the Mind of Love; with no one chasing after fame, power and sensual pleasures; with everyone wanting only to practice and to serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2042&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/thay-eiab-2010-300x226.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; The EIAB[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last April of this year, at the European Institute of Applied Buddhism in Germany, Thay gave a short Dharma talk about the Sangha and the establishment; that it is important to have the presence of a beautiful Sangha first, the establishment is only secondary. Only when we have a truly beautiful peach, do we go looking for a plate or a tray to put the peach on. Without the peach, then what is the use of the plate or the tray? If we do not have this Bat Nha land, then there will be another Bat Nha else where. What is most important is to build a beautiful Sangha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing the Buddha did after achieving enlightenment under the Bodhi Tree was to look for his fellow practitioners in order to build a Sangha. Building Sangha is the career of the Buddhas and it is also the career of any spiritual practitioner. This is also the case for members of the revolution, that is, to build a revolutionary party. Without the Sangha, the career of a Buddha cannot be realized. Without the revolutionary organization, the career of revolutionary also cannot be achieved. During the past sixty years, your teacher has never once neglected the practice of building Sangha. Thay has helped build thousands of Sanghas all over the world, and each Sangha has become a place of refuge for many local practitioners. Dr. Martin Luther King was someone Thay felt close to, and he talked about the Sangha as the “beloved communities”, meaning the “beloved Sangha.” The Bat Nha Sangha is also one of these “beloved Sangha.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Thay was still a young monk during the revolution against the French, Thay had found ways to protect the revolutionaries when they were in danger and was looking for refuge in the temples. This was one of the most dangerous things to do. The French soldiers could shoot us because we dared to shelter these revolutionaries. Thay Tri Thuyen, Thay Tam Thuong and many other young monastics of Thay’s age were shot because they did these things. Thousands of revolutionaries came to hide in the temples, and the monks and nuns always found ways to shelter and to protect them. Everyone did so because we all loved our country and from this love, we wanted to protect the soldiers. In the letter addressed to the President of Vietnam on September 30th, 2009, Thay reminded him of this story. Thay is confident that when the President was still a revolutionary along with many other soldiers who are now veterans of the revolution, he and they had also undergone many life-threatening moments; and that they shall never forget the tight support back then between the people and the soldiers – the same as water is to the fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that same letter, continuing this same spirit, Thay also wrote that the policemen and those who gave them orders to use all means to evict you from Bat Nha,“certainly, they can not be children of the revolution.” Their actions are ungrateful, immoral, and betraying; and are not ones of the true revolutionary tradition. Thay also requested the President to intervene and stop these actions that go against the principles of the revolution and against the traditional virtues and values of our motherland. Why have these policemen behaved like that, using such violent means? Why can’t they continue the integrity and honesty of the revolution? Why are they not children of the revolution? Why do corruption and power abuse permeate everywhere? There is only one accurate answer: It is because the fire of the revolution has extinguished. The virtues of the revolution no longer exist. The source of inspiration, which is the ideal of the revolution, no longer exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we cannot retain our Mind of Love – our Bodhicitta – then we are no longer each other’s “companions on the path” or “friends of the common path”; even though we may refer to ourselves as Buddhists or as disciples of the Buddha. When the aspirations of revolutionaries no longer exists, when we are eroded by corruption and power abuse, then we are no longer each other’s “comrades,” even though on the social level we may still call each other “comrades”. When we have our aspirations, our Mind of Love, our brotherhood and sisterhood, then we no longer need to search for happiness in the direction of money, fame, power and sensual pleasures anymore. Together, we live a healthy and simple life. Thay has sat in meditation with you, eaten in mindfulness with you, breathed with you, listened to the bell with you, gone on walking meditation with you, worked with you, and organized retreats with you. Thay has found a lot happiness in those moments living together. The revolution fighters were also like that. They lived happily together because they shared a common ideal and they were able to let go of what would bring them bondage and restrictions. They fought together side by side, tolerating the storm and wind together, because they had comradeship and because they were kept warm by the sacred fire of the revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_2043&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/reverence-is-the-nature-300x227.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Nature of my love[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking like that does not mean today we cannot re-ignite the fire of the Mind of Love which may have been extinguished in us. It does not mean that we cannot re-ignite the sacred fire of the revolution that has burned out. When you entered the Sangha, the fire of your Mind of Love was inflamed. So many young monastics, after having read the book “Speaking to the Young Monks and Nuns” and having made contact with the Sangha, were able to rekindle their Mind of Love. Thus, we began to live together genuinely and happily because the fire of aspiration was burning brightly within us. And thus with each passing day, young people came in multitude. This influx created fear in the hearts of some people. These people sent their own to infiltrate into our communities in Plum Village, Deer Park, Tu Hieu, Bat Nha and everywhere; to see what we were really doing, and to investigate why we could attract so many young people so quickly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we have any secret? We do not have any secret! If there is such a secret, then it must be because we know how to live truthfully with each other in the spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood. We know how to let go of pursuits that can bring us attachment and bondage. We have a deep aspiration to practice, to help others and to serve all of life. We live each moment with that aspiration. Therefore, when young people interact with us, their hearts are also ignited by this aspiration. This certainly can be accomplished within a community as well as within a revolutionary organization, if only people lived truthfully with each other, if only they can re-ignite the fire of the revolutionary ideal, if only people had the energy derived from their aspiration; then corruption and power abuse will be defeated. Then, those who join the party are no longer the exploiters and opportunists anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If those who come to examine us could see this truth, then both sides would benefit. We may practice in peace, and they, learn ways to revive the confidence in their ideals. Unfortunately, these people can not see this truth and so they are suspicious and from this suspicion, fear is born. Because of this fear, they used unethical means to dissolve a community of young people whom they had felt they could not control. The truth is – why is it necessary to control the cultivation of virtues?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, there lived a king who was curious to find out how a sitar could produce such magical sounds. He gave orders to split the sitar into pieces to find its secret. It was divided into hundreds of parts but he could not find the root of the magical sounds that he had heard. To know its secret, one has to sit quietly and to observe carefully the sitar and the way it is played and not in splitting it open. The Sangha is also like a sitar. To participate in it and observe it carefully and one will see the miracle of the Sangha. Why must one have to split the Sangha up into many pieces by sending each person home? To do so, one loses the opportunity to learn. The veterans of revolution and all of us who has kept a little of the fire of the revolution within our hearts, because of the truth exposed from the Bat Nha crisis, we all have the chance to look deeply in order to rekindle the wonderous flame that had always been in us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The letter is still long. Thay will send you more later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live each day beautifully,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Bat Nha: Diamond Body&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue Cliff, October 7th, 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To my Bat Nha Children,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/diamond.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;I wrote “my Bat Nha children” and not “my children in Bat Nha” as I had done before, because even though you are not living in Bat Nha anymore, you continue to carry the name of the Bat Nha Sangha.  You and Bat Nha are one.  Wherever you go, you carry Bat Nha with you, and Bat Nha has become an indestructible diamond body.  In the opening gatha, which we recite before reading the Diamond Sutra, there is the term “diamond body” as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How may we transcend birth and death
And attain the indestructible diamond body?
How do we practice
So that it may sweep away all illusions?
We ask the Buddha, out of compassion for us,
To open up the treasure store.
For all of us,
Please expound your wonderful teachings!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bat Nha has become a legend, a diamond body – no one can destroy it any more.  Bat Nha is a fragrant lotus that has bloomed from the mud of ignorance, fear, anxiety, corruption and abuse of power.  Bat Nha has made history.  And you are fortunate to have had the opportunity to contribute your part in the manifestation of the Bat Nha lotus.  Bat Nha has become a part of the cultural inheritance of our homeland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Bat Nha children now are not only taking refuge in Phuoc Hue Temple, but you are also present in many places, inside and outside of the country.  Wherever you are, you have the Bat Nha lotus in your hearts.  It is the aspiration to practice and help others.  It is the Beginner’s Mind.  It is the Mind of Love.  It is the source of energy that enables us to still be who we are, helping us not to become corrupted or bought out, or to surrender.  Thay is very happy, because Thay is writing this letter to confide with you.  Under the pen name “Nguyen Lang,” Thay wrote to the president of the country and to the intellectuals in Viet Nam and overseas, asking them to intervene and raise awareness about situation in Bat Nha.  And this is the letter Thay writes to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, Thay wants to let you know that Phuoc Hue Temple, in which a number of you are staying at, is also the place Thay where had lived for many years in the 1950s.  Back then, Thay was still very young, and Phuoc Hue Temple was still very simple, not developed like today.  Behind the temple was a tea garden that had up to a thousand trees.  Thay had a small thatched hut right in the tea garden.  Thay lived there alone.  In the hut, there were only a bed and a table.  Venerable Thai Thuan probably can show you the location of that hut.  One evening, Thay dreamt of his mother; she did not look any different than before, with her long shiny black hair.  While Thay was speaking to his mother with much happiness, he suddenly woke up.  And Thay remembered that his mother had passed away many years before.  Thay got up and opened the door to walk outside.  There was not a restroom inside the hut, because Cong Hinh village (the name of the village in which Phuoc Hue Temple is situated) was in the highland, surrounded by tea trees, so one could urinate right amongst the tea trees.  As soon as Thay stepped out of the hut, Thay was in touch with the bright moonlight draping over the entire tea hill.  It was the waning moon, so bright, beautiful and gentle.  The earth and the sky were calm.  And Thay had a feeling that he was embraced in his mother’s arms; the mother’s love was gentle like the late moonlight.  Suddenly, Thay was enlightened to the fact that his mother had never died, that his mother was always there for him, and that her true nature was no birth and no death.  All the sadness and yearning Thay had felt after he lost his mother disappeared at once, and Thay smiled in the late moonlight.  Thay recalls that he had recorded this story somewhere, perhaps in the book Fragrant Palm Leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay knows that the tea hill does not exist anymore.  The thatched hut is also no longer there.  But if you have a chance to do walking meditation around the Phuoc Hue Temple in an evening when there is the moon, visualize that wonderful night and, looking up at the moon, you will see Thay and Thay’s mother smiling with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the teaching tour 2009 in the United States, a miracle happened, and that was the retreat at Estes Park in Colorado.  This retreat had 980 retreatants coming from many different states.  It started from August 21st to 26th , 2009.  Among those retreatants there were about 50 percent who had never met Thay, listened to Thay’s teachings, or participated in a retreat with Thay.  They only knew Thay through his books, published in the U.S.  They came to the retreat with the intention to listen directly to Thay’s teachings and guidance.  Many of them had to fly several hours to get to Denver.  They then had to take the bus to go up to the mountain to attend the retreat.  The YMCA (Young Men’s Christian Association) is in Estes Park, and they have the capacity to provide housing, food and restrooms for over one thousand people.  It is situated 1000 meters above sea level, so it is very cool and cold.  The mountains are majestic and luscious.  Every two years Thay comes to lead a retreat there, and every retreat is full of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this time, Thay could not attend and guide the retreat because of his illness.  The doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), after having made the diagnosis, recommended that Thay stop leading the retreat at Stonehill College in Massachusetts and that Thay should also cancel the retreat in YMCA in order to treat his lung infection.  The doctors said Thay had to stay in the hospital at least 14 days for the treatment.  Doctor Sicilian – known for his specialty in treating pulmonary infection caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, and responsible for the special treatment unit on the 12th floor of the hospital – advised Thay to be hospitalized immediately that evening so that the treatment can begin.  But Thay decided to return to Stonehill to complete that retreat, before Thay returned to check himself into the hospital.  The theme of the retreat in Stonehill was Be Peace, Be Joy, Be Hope. The retreat had started on August 11th, 2009.  And at about 5 p.m. on August 13th, 2009, Thay had some time to go for a check-up.  A few weeks before, symptoms of the chronic lung infection had become severe, and occasionally Thay saw bright fresh or old dark blood in his sputum.  After five hours of waiting and testing, all the doctors advised Thay to begin the treatment immediately, without delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay got back to the college at 12 midnight, and the next morning, Thay went to sitting meditation with the Sangha, gave the Dharma talk, and went on walking meditation as if nothing had happened.  No one knew that Thay was sick.  Everyone said that the Dharma talks on the last three days of the retreats were powerful.  Thay Phap De said to Thay that, “You were luminous during these Dharma talks.”  Only your elder brothers and sisters knew that Thay was sick, and Thay was going to the hospital right after the end of the retreat. On August 14th, there was a special meeting of the Dharma teachers in which they were informed that Thay would be hospitalized on Monday August 17th, and that Thay was not going to fly to Denver to lead the retreat.  In that meeting, the Dharma teachers delegated to each other the responsibilities to lead the retreat in Thay’s place.  Everyone  took the initiative to volunteer, without waiting to be invited or asked.  The retreat in Stonehill also had almost one thousand retreatants.  Except for the monastic Dharma teachers, no one knew that Thay was not going to attend the retreat in YMCA, Estes Park, including the monks and nuns.  Only when it was almost time to get on the bus to go to the airport did the brothers and sisters know that Thay was not going to fly with them.  This was the first time that this happened:  Thay could not attend the retreat, and the Sangha had to lead it for Thay.  The organizing team was aware that the time was near.  There was not enough time to postpone the retreat, because everything had been prepared, from housing, food, registration, to plane tickets; some were already on their way to the retreat by car or by bus from other states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With certainty, there would be many retreatants disappointed or angry on the arrival day, when they found out that Thay could not be there.  Many of them had read Thay’s books for many years, and it was their first opportunity to meet Thay and practice with Thay.  There were those who promised their friends and relatives that after the retreat, they would come back to tell them about their experience with Thay.  The more hope and waiting there were, the greater the disappointment and sadness would be.  The monastic brothers and sisters flew to Denver with that awareness, but everyone had enough courage to take on the responsibility:  This was an opportunity to prove that they were worthy of the trust of the Buddha, of the patriarchs and of Thay.  The opportunity was now or never.  Therefore, everyone was determined, and all joined efforts to lead the retreat with all of their hearts and minds.  The energy as well as the brotherhood and sisterhood had never been as stable and strong as during those days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Thay began to be treated in MGH, the largest and most well-known hospital in  the northeast of the United States.  Thay was hospitalized on August 17th, and on the morning of August 21st, Thay wrote a letter to the retreatants at YMCA, Estes Park, Colorado.  From the hospital, Thay was informed that upon listening to Thay’s letter that evening, many people cried, monastic as well as lay.  After reading the letter, the brothers and sisters invoked the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, and then they gave an orientation about the practices for the whole retreat.  After the orientation, the entire community practiced Noble Silence until after lunch the next day.  The practice of Noble Silence helped the retreat greatly.  Many people had the opportunity to recognize and embrace their disappointments and reactions – mental formations that arose when they received the news that Thay was not present in the retreat.  The next morning walking meditation, the silent breakfast and the first Dharma talk helped many retreatants to embrace and transform their disappointment, worry, and other negative mental formations.
&lt;em&gt;
The letter is still long.  Thay will send more to you later…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;A Young Monastic’s Dream&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;My dear students, near and far,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thay-young.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the Daily Chanting book, there is a chant that I really liked when I was a novice. The prose of this piece is very beautiful, and its content has a great capacity to nourish the aspiration of monastics. Every time the novice Phùng Xuân [Thầy’s earlier name] chanted that piece, he allowed the words to embrace him and penetrate deeply into his blood vessels and into every cell of his body. This chant is a monastic’s beautiful dream, and I have a lot of gratitude to the Zen master who wrote it. You already know that chant, it is the Beginning Anew and Refuge Chant for Life. Its original title is The Vow Chant. Zen master Jiao Ran (皎 然) wrote it during the Tang dynasty. He was very famous as a poet and writer. He was the one who wrote the epitaphs for the first Zen masters. Yí Shan (怡山) is the mountain where he lived. People called him Zen master Yí Shan (怡山) instead of Zen master Jiao Ran (皎 然), out of respect. Before becoming a monk, his last name was Xie (谢) and his first name was Qing Zhou (请 晝). The famous work he transmitted to us is the Collection of the Storage Mountain, Chu Shan Ji (儲 山 集), a collection of ten volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the commentaries of the Daily Chanting Book, Zen master Guan Yue (觀月) wrote: ‘If you don’t like this Beginning Anew and Refuge Chant for Life, then you can replace it with another one, like Touching the Earth Chant, the Chant to the Buddhas in the Ten Directions and of the Three Times, or One-Pointed-Mind Refuge Chant.’ But who doesn’t like this chant? I think that many, many generations of monastics have been nourished and comforted by this chant. Even before I was twenty years old, I dreamed of translating it into Vietnamese. And that dream was realized when I was a young Dharma teacher at The Nam Việt Buddhist Institute. I translated it into the traditional Vietnamese form of a six-eight-verse poem. At that time, many monks and nuns in the Institute (Ấn Quang Temple) learned it by heart. That chant is currently published in our book Chanting from the Heart and other daily chanting books in different languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the verses in the Chinese text consist of four or six words, skillfully selected to create a tone that is at times gentle and soothing, and other times vigorous and powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘In my next life, thanks to holy seeds of wisdom that have been planted in this life, may I be reborn into an environment with a rich culture, and as I grow, may I be fortunate to meet a wise teacher and be ordained in my childhood. May my six senses be keen and my body, speech and mind be harmonious. May I not be polluted by worldly habit energies and may I live a holy and benevolent life. I will diligently practice the precepts and mindful manners. Free from worldly karma, I will know how to protect all living beings, even the smallest ones.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I will practice the authentic Dharma and will understand deeply the Mahayana teachings. I will be able to open the door of action to the six paramitas and realize what other practitioners have to spend billions of lifetimes in order to realize.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dear, reading these words, do you feel that these are great dreams? How can we give rise to such aspirations if we don’t have the seed of bodhicitta or a bodhisattva vow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s continue to read the next section together :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I will establish practice centers everywhere. I will break the many layers in the net of doubt. I will conquer all obstacles of temptation and will transmit the lamp of the True Dharma, so that the Three Jewels will keep shining forever in the future. I will assist all the buddhas in the ten directions and never tire. I will practice and realize all the Dharma doors. I will cultivate insight and do social service for the benefit of all beings in the world. I will attain the six miraculous powers and realize the fruit of awakening right in this lifetime.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Afterwards, I will not leave the world of reality, but will be present in all places. The energy of my compassion will not be less than that of Avalokita, and my ocean of vows will be as vast as Samantabhadra’s.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘In this world and other worlds, I will manifest in different bodies in order to spread the wonderful Dharma.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘In the realms of hells and hungry ghosts, I will radiate light, or perform miracles so that whoever sees me or hears my name will give rise to the mind of love and immediately overcome all suffering.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘All the lifeless lands parched dry by fire, all the rivers frozen by ice, I will transform into lush and fragrant forests.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘During times of epidemics, I will create a myriad of herbal medicines to heal even incurable sicknesses. In times of severe famine, I will produce an abundance of grains to alleviate hunger and poverty.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I will not decline any work that will bring benefits to all people.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I will help everyone, friends and foes in many lifetimes, as well as relatives in this life, so that each can release the bonds of attachment, and together with all living beings, we will attain enlightenment.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘My aspiration is even more boundless than space itself. I vow that all beings, sentient and non-sentient, will all attain the fruits of the highest awakening.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words of this chant long ago watered the bodhicitta seeds of the young novice chanting every morning. He did not know why, but he always believed that that dream would come true, even though all around him, there was no sign to indicate it, and no one had been able to realize it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words of this chant are so beautiful that I’ve been using them as Dharma names for ordinees at Plum Village. For example, Chân Hương Lâm is the name given to the venerable nun Đàm Nguyện who lives in Hanôi. Hương Lâm means fragrant forests. ‘All the lifeless lands parched dry by fire, all the rivers frozen by ice, I will transform them into lush and fragrant forests.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is truly poetic, as well as aligned with our aspiration to protect the environment. The verses are so powerful that we feel as if we are no longer small devotees praying, but great beings with miraculous power to liberate all beings without exceptions. ‘The energy of my compassion will not be less than that of Avalokita, and my ocean of vows will be as vast as Samantabhadra’s.’ Those reciting this chant no longer have an inferiority complex, and feel they too capable of accomplishing the deeds of these great bodhisattvas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such verses can shake the whole being of those who chant them: ‘Whoever sees me or hears my name will give rise to the mind of love and immediately overcome all suffering.’ We know: I’m not less than any buddha or bodhisattva on his or her path of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it just a dream?  Or is it something to be realized?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many generations of practitioners, including you, have chanted this refuge chant, and have probably asked this question. I myself did not ask it. Even though around me, there was no sign to indicate that the dream could be realized, I kept it in my heart and held the conviction that it would come true. The 1940’s and 50’s were decades of war and hunger. The monastics tried every way possible to maintain the practice within the boundaries of their temples, but still, they encountered many difficulties. Even young monastics were oppressed, imprisoned, and murdered. As a young monk, I studied the history of the Ly and Tran dynasties and understood that if Buddhism had the capacity to strengthen and sustain the nation’s peace and prosperity during those periods, then it should still have the same capacity in our time. Why not? That was my question, even though during those decades, Buddhism was still incapable of overcoming the situation of decline. Perhaps the great contributions of Buddhism during the Ly and Tran dynasties gave me confidence that this dream was not merely a dream but something to be realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a young Dharma teacher at Ấn Quang monastery, I translated that chant with a humble language. I translated this passage: ‘The energy of my compassion will not be less than that of Avalokita, and my ocean of vows will be as vast as Samantabhadra’s’ as: ‘The rain of loving kindness permeates the worlds of gods and men, the vow of helping all beings is the vast ocean of action.’ ‘Whoever sees me or hears my name will give rise to the mind of love and immediately overcome all suffering’ was translated as ‘Upon seeing that image or hearing that name, it’s enough for all beings to be liberated from all bondage and pain.’ For many years living in the West, I did not have a chance to chant that translation again, so all but a few sections faded from my memory until Venerable Như Huệ, abbot of Pháp Hoa Temple in Australia, came to Plum Village in the summer of 1994 as one of the witnesses in the Hương Tích Ceremony of Full Ordination. He recited it for me and I copied down the whole text. Venerable Như Huệ had memorized it back when he was a young monk studying at the Nam Việt Buddhist Institute, about fifty years ago. Thanks to that encounter, we have been able to restore the translation of the chant in our Vietnamese Daily Chanting book, and we have now translated it into English and other languages. I think we need to chant it at least once every week, so that our bodhicitta can be continuously nourished. Bodhicitta is the vow, the aspiration, the dream of authentic practitioners. If our bodhicitta is eroded, we will not have enough energy to go forward and realize our dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, during the sitting meditation, let us contemplate in order to see that our dream is slowly coming true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘In my next life may I be reborn as a human being, encountering the Dharma and living the life of an authentic practitioner under the guidance of wise teachers.’ This has been fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘My six senses, body, speech and mind are all in harmony, free from the circle of Samsara; I wholeheartedly practice mindfulness with my body and go forward on the path. Practicing chastity, I am far from the world of suffering.’ That is our daily practice of precepts and mindful manners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Practice centers are established in all places; the net of doubt is totally swept away from deep within and without.’ This is what we are muadiligently doing. Today, our sanghas are present all around the world. There are hundreds of groups in many countries practicing mindful living together. Big cities like New York, Paris, London, Amsterdam, Los Angeles and Berlin have many sanghas. Retreats are organized everywhere. Works on engaged Buddhism have become a net of Dharma, clearing misunderstandings, misperceptions and doubt about Buddhism, revealing Buddhism to be a scientific humanism, not a theocratic religion, not superstitious or pessimistic. That is the meaning of ‘The net of doubt is totally swept away from deep within and without.’&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/young-monastic-dream.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Transmitting the Dharma Lamp to continue the endless stream.’ We have trained many Dharma teachers and Dharma teacher apprentices, monastics as well as lay. Currently, over 300 people have received the Lamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘We aspire to bring medical aid to the sick, food to the hungry. With joy and happiness, we bring much benefit to all those who suffer in the world.’ This is social service, one part of applied Buddhism, of engaged Buddhism.  We founded the School of Youth and Social Service where we trained over 600 social workers and thousands of assistants and volunteers. Pilot villages (Hoa Tiêu and Tự Nguyện) were established in order to increase the quality of life, focusing on the four areas of education, health care, economy and organization. Our social workers wholeheartedly helped war victims and cared for people in refugee camps, some of which held up to 11,000 people. They restored villages ravaged by war and built up new villages. Our Association of Social Restoration and Development worked with the Vietnamese Unified Buddhist Church (1972-1975). We had a program supporting over 10,000 war orphans. With our Boat People Program, we rescued people adrift at sea. We established the organization Pour les Enfants du Vietnam, then Partage avec les Enfants du Monde, helping children from 17 countries including Vietnam. Our Understanding and Love Program has been providing aid for flood victims, helping the poor by offering instruction in technical trades, building bridges, digging wells, opening basic schools for children living in remote areas and providing lunch for them, paying the salaries of thousands of teachers and childcare workers.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wonderful thing is that while these social workers do their jobs, they practice mindfulness trainings, sitting meditation, walking meditation, build brotherhood and sisterhood and learn to flow as one river....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I will not decline any work that will bring benefits to all people.’ This is our vow of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Dharma teachers, some of whom are still in their youth, are really bringing Buddhism into the world, engaged Buddhism. We have organized special retreats for people from all professions and backgrounds: social workers, artists, movie actors and film makers, educators, business people, physicians and nurses, congressmen and senators, police officers, peace activists, ecologists, etc. In some retreats, up to 2000 participants attended, like the one in Washington DC for psychologists and psychotherapists. We have introduced the practice in jails and hospitals to help people heal and transform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from engaged Buddhism, we have moved forward to applied Buddhism, including the Wake Up movement for young people in the world -- practice communities for a healthy and compassionate society. We have founded the European Institute of Applied Buddhism, offering retreats to parents who have difficulties with their children, to young people who have lost communication with their parents, to those who have just been diagnosed with a terminal illness, to those who have just lost their loved ones. Anyone can come and practice without having to become Buddhist. The Buddhism that we offer to the world is not a religion, but an art of living, with methods to transform and heal...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/young-monastic-dream-solar-panel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;We are doing our best to preserve the environment, both by way of our own practice and inspiring others to live in such a way that the Earth has a future, that the process of global warming can be reversed. Our Deer Park Monastery is currently running entirely on solar energy. All our practice centers and sanghas are practicing mindful consumption, with one car-free day per week... All of these initiatives prove that we are committed to realizing our dream with determination, that we are not simply sitting around letting the chant carry us away to a utopian fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Buddhism with its mindfulness practice has gradually been incorporated into the areas of law, science, medical and social studies. The Buddhist spirit of tolerance, of non-dualistic view and non-attachment to views has started to be acknowledged by the world. In the midst of globalization, Buddhism can offer important contributions toward a universal ethic. We know this dream can come true, and it is coming true. If we are not caught in status, fame, money, praise, etc.; if we know how to go with the sangha as a river, and not as a separate drop of water, then we will have more chance to realize this dream. Isn’t that right, my dear? I hope to hear your feedback after you read this letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your teacher,
Nhất Hạnh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;livecodeserver&quot;&gt;Since &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1961&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; Saigon Buddhist Student Association &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; other Buddhist students like Huê Dương, Chiểu, Khanh, Chi, Nhiên, &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Phượng have offered these services &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; poor districts, like Mã Lạng Quốc Thanh &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Cầu Bông Bàn Cờ, &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; night classes &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; high school level &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; free. In &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1964&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;65&lt;/span&gt;, we have started building &lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;Love Villages&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; your eldest brother Nhất Trí, brothers Tâm Quang, Tâm Thái, &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; hundred Buddhist students, including Phượng, Thảo, Thanh, Uyên, Tuyết, Quyền, Trâm, Nguyên, Tích, Thanh, &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Tài. We have organized groups &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; students &lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; raise funds &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; flood &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; famine victims living along &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; Thu Bồn River following &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1964&lt;/span&gt; typhoon.
We have established &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; School &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; Youth &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Social Service (&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1965&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1975&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;  Association &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; Social Restoration &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Development (&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1971&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1975&lt;/span&gt;, under &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; leadership &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; Venerable Thiện Hò&lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;). Brothers Thanh Văn, Châu Toàn, Từ Mẫn,  &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Phạm Phước were &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;among&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; bodhisattva’s arms coordinating thousands &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; social workers, assistants, &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; volunteers who accomplished so many projects &lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; help tens &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; thousands &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; war victims. Seventeen &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; them died &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; course &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; their missions, including Liên, Vui, Thơ, Tuấn, Hy, Lành, &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; your elder brother Nhất Trí. Bùi Thị Hương had &lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; have her leg amputated, &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Lê Văn Vinh has &lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; spend &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; rest &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; his life &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; wheelchair. Nhất Chi Mai, eldest sister &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;constant&quot;&gt;six&lt;/span&gt; members &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; our Order &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; Interbeing, immolated herself &lt;span class=&quot;command&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;July&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;1967&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;peace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;between&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;warring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;sides&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
As part &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; our Boat People Program &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; South China Sea, &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1976&lt;/span&gt; Phượng (Sister Chân Không), Luke Fogarty, Trang Fogarty, Kirsten Roep, &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Mobi Warren rescued &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;606&lt;/span&gt; people. Phượng organized &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;an&lt;/span&gt; underground mission &lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; rescue boat people &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; our fishing boat &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; Bay &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; Thailand, &lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1976&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1978.&lt;/span&gt; Then we established another program &lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; assist boat people, sending spiritual &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; material support, English &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; French textbooks, &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; chanting books &lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; refugee camps &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; Songklha, Trad, Sikkhiu, Chonburi...
From &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1975&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;until&lt;/span&gt; now, we have been silently helping &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; hungry children &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; poor elderly &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; Understanding &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Love Social Assistant Program. In &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; West, this program has been wholeheartedly supported &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; Kirsten Roep &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Hebe Kohbrugge &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; Netherlands, &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; Pour les Enfants du Vietnam, Partage avec les Enfants du Monde, &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Partage (&lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; Pierre Marchand) &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; France. Through &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; latter &lt;span class=&quot;constant&quot;&gt;two&lt;/span&gt; programs, we have aided hungry children &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; seventeen underdeveloped countries including Bangladesh, India, Lebanon, Brazil, &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Colombia. The Maitreya Funds &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; Germany was founded &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; Chân Pháp Nhãn (Karl Schmied) &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Chân Diệu Từ, &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; now is continued &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; Chân Giác Lưu (Christian Kảufl). The Swiss Sangha, &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; Margrit Witwer, &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; Italian Sangha have been fully supporting our Understanding &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Love Program. The Boat &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; Compassion Sangha led &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; Chân Ý &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Chân Trí (Anh Hư?ng &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Thư Nguyên) has supported over &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt; hungry children &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; Quảng Trị &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Thừ&lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; Thiên. Snow Flower Sangha has donated dozens &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; wells &lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; big families living &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; remote areas &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;without&lt;/span&gt; electricity &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; running water. Minh &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Liên &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; their Compassionate Eye Program have annually cooperated &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; Toronto Sangha &lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; support many flood victims. Hussman Foundation &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; US has supported &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;75&lt;/span&gt; teachers &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; childcare workers, &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;700&lt;/span&gt; malnourished children &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; provinces Bảo Lâm &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Di Linh, &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; well &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; donating funds &lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; build &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; meditation hall &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; Prajna Monastery. Lilian Cheung has contributed &lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; build &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; nunneries Diệu Nghiêm &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Diệu Trạm.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early years 1975-1990, when social services still encountered many obstacles, thanks to Venerable Nun Tịnh Nguyện and Thuần, we were able to smuggle gifts for people suffering in the toughest reeducation camps like Hàm Tân, Hà Nam Ninh, and Vĩnh Phú. We also contacted writers and poets who had lost their will to write, expressing our appreciation, trust and care to them, so that they were inspired to resume their creative work. Thanks to the courage and the dedication of Venerable Nun Trí Hải and her disciples, with their car packed full with medications, rice and clothing, and offering spontaneous &amp;quot;mini Dharma talks,&amp;quot; we also sent gifts to the poor, newly-built villages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before 1975, the Senior Nuns Cát Tường, Thể Quán, Thể Thanh, Như Huyền and Viên Minh, and the Senior Monks Chánh Trực, Như Vạn, Long Trí were all bodhisattva arms reaching far and wide to help people. Today, this loving work is continued by Venerable Hải Ấn in Huế; Venerable Nuns Đàm Nguyện in Hanôi, Như Minh, Diệu Đạt, Minh Tánh in Huế, Hạnh Toàn in Quảng Ngãi, Giới Minh; Brother Pháp Lộ, Sister Y Nghiêm, Chân Tướng Hòa, Việt, Tân, Dũng, Mai, Xuân, Tuyết, Thân, Chân Đoan...  During the post-war years, through Chân Thể Hòa and Thuần, we sent money and rice to poor people living in remote areas. With the hands of Chân Dụng Hòa, Chân Hỷ Căn, A, and Viễn, we looked after disabled and lonely senior citizens, offered the gift of sight to those with cataracts, and raised funds to pay salaries of hundreds of teachers, opening kindergartens and schools in remote areas and providing not only instruction but also lunches and soy milk to malnourished children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sangha arms are very long indeed, reaching out far and wide --  not only in Vietnam; but all around the world, in Bangladesh, India, Israel, Palestine...&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Everyone can see Thay in the Sangha&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Friends and Co-practitioners at the “One Buddha is Not Enough” Retreat&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dear Friends,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/everyone-can-see-thay-300x199.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is Thay again writing to you from the Massachusetts General Hospital. The treatment is going well and we have noticed several aspects of the improvement of Thay’s conditions after the first week. Thank you for having sent your loving energy to Thay. I learned that you all, both monastic and lay members of the Sangha, have practiced beautifully with all your hearts in the retreat. And that makes Thay very happy. The most wonderful thing is that after a few moments of sadness, worry and disappointment, all of us have settled down to practice and conduct the retreat the most wonderful way a Sangha could. The transformation and the joy you feel presently at the retreat is very nourishing and encouraging for Thay and for everyone of us. By now all of us have already seen the talent and the miracle of the Sangha. We have to acknowledge the fact that the Sangha has embodied the continuation of Thay in a beautiful way, and there is no reason for anyone of us to worry about the future of our practice. King Prasenajit of Shravasti one day told the Buddha that when he observed the Sangha, he could truly see the Buddha. One of the achievements of this retreat is that everyone can see Thay in the Sangha, including those who come to the retreat for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sangha is quite capable to continue the work of the Buddha and of our ancestral teachers. Thay would like to propose that the Colorado Retreat become an annual retreat in the tradition of Plum Village; and that all of you, as conditions permitted, will come together as members of the Sangha to allow other people to have a chance to practice the Dharma. Thus everyone of us in this retreat becomes a continuation of Thay. Much happiness has come to Thay’s heart every time Thay remembers that he has already had  a beautiful continuation. I have full confidence in the Sangha, and trust that my Sangha will always be able to perform the miracle of the practice, whether with or without Thay’s physical presence. Thay will be very happy to hear from each of you on this proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you again all my friends and disciples, and I hope to see you again very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love and trust,
Thay&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Sitting Still, Imperturbable&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sitting Still Hut, Upper Hamlet, Plum Village
July 20, 2009&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To my students in Bat Nha, Tu Hieu and everywhere,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bat-nha1-300x225.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thay is sitting at “Sitting Still Hut,” in the Upper Hamlet of Plum Village while writing this letter to you.  The Summer Retreat in Plum Village is very joyful and peaceful.  There is economic difficulty in the world, but the number of people coming to Plum Village during the four weeks is still very high, and perhaps it is higher than the previous years.  Not only are there many children, but the teenagers from age 13 to 18 are also numerous.  The number of young adults from 18 to 25 is also quite high.  Each age group practices together, having Dharma discussions and eating dinner together, in order to share their practice experiences with each other and to build brotherhood and sisterhood.  The Wake Up movement for the young Western friends is also growing quickly.  Have you seen the Wake Up T-shirts?  There are many young people coming to Plum Village yearly; they are used to the way of life and practice in Plum Village, so they are able to help those who just come for the first time.  On the morning of July 16th, 2009, in the New Hamlet, Brother Phap Trien displayed for the first time the wrist-watch bearing the sign of the present moment. This watch was designed by our young monks in the Upper Hamlet, with Thay’s calligraphy:  ”It’s now.”  Anytime we raise our hands to look at our watch, it will let us know that this is the present moment.  There is a design for men and a design for women.  That same day, 150 people came to the bookshop to buy the watch.  One lay practitioner clicked his tongue and said, “This is really a brilliant idea.”  We call it “the watch of the present moment.”  Brother Phap Trien was one of the two young monks who helped Thay to design this watch.  The other was Brother Phap Chieu, who is also very young, and who will receive the lamp transmission at the end of this year!  This watch is made in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/nowwatch-214x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wkup-300x201.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were up to 800 lay friends who came to the third week of the Summer Retreat, representing about 50 countries in the world.  Including permanent residents, right now we have over 1000 people in the four hamlets.  Yet it is very peaceful and calm.  Everyone is happy to do walking meditation to the hillside of New Hamlet, to the forest of Lower Hamlet, and to do sitting meditation under the oak trees of Upper Hamlet, looking in the direction of the Lower Mountain Hamlet.  The Pure Land is no longer a notion; it becomes a reality during those walking and sitting meditation sessions.  Children as well as adults are able to dwell in the present moment.  Yesterday while giving the Dharma talk, Thay saw a mother listening to the Dharma talk and breast-feeding her child at the same time; both mother and child were clearly happy.  In the Asian culture, it is not yet acceptable for a mother to listen to the Dharma talk while breast-feeding her child, because people will think that it is not respectful enough of an expression towards the Dharma.  But Thay thinks that this is an environment for Applied Buddhism – the child, while receiving her mother’s nutritious milk for her body, can also benefit from the peaceful and calm atmosphere of the meditation hall as spiritual food.  To Thay, this is a beautiful image.  We don’t know if our camera brother or sister had a chance to video it or not.  During the four weeks, even though the monastic and long-term practitioners had to invest a lot of time and mind-power to guide and care for our lay friends, all of us felt happy about the lay friends’ happiness.  The transformation and joy of our lay friends are the substances that nourish the happiness of our permanent residents.  Having the opportunity to bring happiness to others is the aspiration of spiritual practitioners, and we, teacher and students, have this opportunity at Plum Village, Deer Park, Blue Cliff, and everywhere else.  Thay envisions clearly that in the future, every country must have many practice centers like Plum Village in order to accommodate the growing need to practice of the people.  The Dharma teachers whom we are training will have the responsibility to establish practice centers like that everywhere in the future.  Our aim is not to transmit the teachings; neither is it to obtain more Buddhist followers.  Our aim is to establish practice environments, so that everyone has a chance to come to practice, transforming their suffering and learning how to live with more happiness. We never want lay practitioners to deny their cultural and spiritual roots.  On the contrary, we always encourage them to come back to clear the stream of their traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Worrying back and forth”&lt;/strong&gt;
We have learned a lot from what has happened to Prajna Monastery during the past months. Thay has received many letters from those of you at Prajna these last few weeks. You tell me many stories, but there is no letter that doesn’t have the phrase: “Dear Thay, please don’t worry about us.” Your statement means that: Dear Thay, we are not worried about ourselves, but we are worried that you are worried about us! If Thay is worried, then Thay will get sick and it will spoil everything. Therefore, Thay is writing this letter to let you know: Thay is not worried about you, so don’t be worried about Thay. Don’t “worry back and forth.” Each side only needs to behave beautifully, doing our part, and that is enough! Is that message clear, my dear children?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay is not worried about you, but it does not mean that Thay is not paying attention to you. Thay pays attention to you every day, every hour, and every minute. Thay is not worried about you because Thay has confidence in you. Thay has the confidence that you can behave true to the Dharma in challenging and difficult circumstances. And you have proven that you can do it. And because of that, Thay’s confidence in you has grown quickly. This brings so much happiness both to Thay and to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the old times, your Grandfather Teacher Thanh Quy [Thay’s root teacher] never told Thay that he loved Thay or that he had confidence in Thay. That was the way of the elder generation. They believed if they expressed their love that it would lose some sacredness. However, Thay could feel the love and trust from Grandfather Teacher, and Thay was very happy. There is no greater happiness for a disciple than that of knowing that he/she is loved and trusted by his/her teacher. For Thay’s whole life of practice, Thay has been nourished by that quiet love and trust from Grandfather Teacher. And Thay believes that Grandfather Teacher also had a lot of happiness when he had disciples to which he could entrust all of his love and confidence. Thay is someone with great happiness, because Thay has confidence in you. To have confidence in you means to have confidence in the future. Suppose we don’t have confidence in the future–is it possible then that we can live happily?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay trusts that you have enough capacity to understand, to love, and to respond with non-violence. If we can maintain our loving kindness and compassion and respond with loving kindness and compassion in any difficult situation, then we will be protected by a wholesome energy. That is the energy of the Three Jewels. There is no protection that is as stable and safe as the energy of the Three Jewels, of understanding and of compassion. The day Thay received the news that people invaded your monastic residence Fragrant Palm Forest, throwing out your belongings, pushing whoever got in their way, and going to the third floor only to find all of you doing sitting meditation, evoking the Bodhisattva of Deep Listening Avalokiteshvara in the imperturbable posture, and not trying to react or fight back, Thay knew that you are able to do what Thay has hoped for, and there is no more reason for Thay to be worried about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thay is not worried about you, but many people have been very worried about you–those within the country and around the world; Vietnamese people as well as international friends; Buddhists as well as non-Buddhists. Not only are your parents and relatives are worried, but the four-fold sanghas, with or without responsibility in the Buddhist Church, are also worried about you. Your elder and younger monastic brothers and sisters everywhere in the country and outside of the country are also worried about you. And like you, everyone is also worried about Thay. They are worried that Thay is worried. And if Thay is worried, Thay will be sick. Right here in Plum Village your monastic brothers and sisters all thought that Thay was very worried about you, especially during the most heated days. During those days, Thay often did sitting meditation or walking meditation to send extra energy to you. It was on one of the most intense days when all monastics from the four hamlets came to Thay’s hermitage to attend the Monastic Day. Seeing that Thay was sitting by the stream Phuong Khe, looking fresh and without worry, they were all surprised and glad. It turned out that everyone was worried about you and about Thay. Poor things! Thay heard on that very evening that there was a big storm in Prajna. Everyone was happy. When it was that rainy and stormy, people would not have the chance to come and harasss you. When the rain was that heavy, at least you could collect some water so that you could endure through the day. One close friend told Thay that he called to Prajna on one of those heated days, and he could hear the laughter of the young monks and nuns; this made him feel reassured. Thay believes that if there were no brotherhood and sisterhood; if we did not know our direction and the way to behave in difficult situations; and if we did not have faith in the path of love, there is no way we could maintain that laughter and that joy for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tangthankhatthuc-300x197.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;The difficulties happening to Prajna not only increase Thay’s confidence and trust in you, but they also open the eyes of many people. Thanks to those difficulties the truth slowly is revealed. All along, people want to say that what happens at Prajna is a small, internal thing, not worth communicating as news, not worth the attention of people inside and outside of the country. We all knew from the beginning that this was not about an internal struggle over a temple, but it was the result of a delusion: that the presence of Prajna may be a threat to national security, because the monastics at Prajna, that means you, are people who want to do politics. Didn’t the television channel in Lam Dong suggest that theory twice? There was someone phoning to find ways to help Prajna, and he was told: ”This is an issue about national security, and you should not get involved.” What has been happening at Prajna prove that those fabrications are completely untrue. Projecting it like that, making up things like that is like what is said in the sutra about drawing a painting in the air: without the canvas, without the sketch paper, it can never be drawn! Now everyone within the country and around the world is able to see that the monks and the nuns and the aspirants at Prajna only do one thing. That is: to practice and to guide others to practice. The aim of practitioners is to practice for ourselves in order to transform and recover the ethical and cultural values that were and are being eroded slowly, so that we can help to stop the spread of social afflictions, such as violence, drug addiction, prostitution, suicide, broken families, corruption, and the abuse of power. At the same time, we can help everyone in society to have a healthy spiritual direction. After those storms, everyone sees that you are true practitioners. You are young, but your aspiration to help others is very great, and your confidence in your national ethics is unshakable. You did not come to Prajna to seek after fame, position, or land, but you came for an ideal – an ideal to practice in order to help life. There were a number of people incited to come to Prajna to threaten you and to chase you away, but thanks to your loving and non-violent responses they have realized that you are real practitioners, that you are their children, their brothers and sisters, their spiritual companions. So they cried and left. Do you remember those times when people were told to attack you? When they heard your evocation of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, many of them joined their palms and directed themselves towards your living quarters Cloud on the Mountain, Glowing Hearth, and Fragrant Palm Forest? After that, they left without joining the mob. It was because of your compassionate and non-violent behavior that they realized that what they had heard was untrue; and what they had witnessed was the image of true young practitioners. Thay trusts that many police officers, after days and months of interacting with you, having demanded your legal papers and proofs of residency, and having witnessed many groups of people organized to come to Prajna to insult you and incite you – they have also realized that you are true practitioners, and that you have no desire for politics. With certainty, there are police officers who come home and cry alone in the dark, not understanding why they have to do the things they do not really want to do, and asking themselves why is the presence of peaceful monks and nuns like that dangerous to national security as others have told them so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With certainty, the Venerable Duc Nghi also knows clearly that you are true monastic practitioners, carrying out the precepts and the mindful manners faithfully. Thay Duc Nghi also has his own suffering. On the one hand, he wants to realize his own ambitions. On the other hand, he is feeling guilty and uneasy because he has to behave unkindly to his own brothers and sisters on the path. Thay heard that there is not a night that Thay Duc Nghi does not cry. How painful this is! Su Phu Duc Nghi [our young brothers and sisters refer to the Venerable Abbot as “Su Phu,” which means Teacher Father] told your elder brothers many times that he received a lot of pressure from the outside. The disciples of Su Phu Duc Nghi also know that you practice precepts and mindful manners with stability, that you only want to practice, and that you never want to get involved in politics or to take possessions from someone else. However, once they are webbed into the machinery they cannot stop. The Dong Brothers [the Venerable Duc Nghi&amp;#39;s monastic students] also have their own suffering, and certainly, they can neither sleep well nor eat well. Thay heard that you always treat the Dong Brothers with respect, that you never criticize or reproach them, and that every time you see them, you join your palms as a lotus to greet them. Thay is very happy about this. Our basic practice is not to allow our brotherhood and sisterhood to be destroyed. We have to be prepared so that when that day comes we can mend our relationship easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true practice is not just practicing precepts and mindful manners outwardly in the form. If we do not know how to look deeply, if we do not have effective practices, then we cannot take care of the energies of violence, fear, cowardice, and hatred in us. When those energies control our bodies and minds, we cannot pretend to be calm and non-violent. Thay heard the story about one of our young novices, who has been ordained for less than a year, and who had been trained in martial arts. When a number of young men came to your living quarter The Beginner’s Mind and threw your beds and belongings outside deliberately, that young brother could not endure their violent provocation. He asked his mentor for permission to handle those men. The young novice said, “Please allow me to quit being a monk. I cannot bear it anymore. I only need 15 minutes to defeat all of those gangsters. After that, if needed, I will go to prision for six months to a year. When I finish my term, I will return to be a monk again.” His mentor was a young Dharma teacher, not yet 30 years old, but he said to his mentee: “Dear brother, don’t call those young people gangsters. They are also young people like you, but they were misinformed, so they behave like that. They are thinking that we are gangsters who have come here to take over the buildings and the land. They are victims of wrong information, and they need help more than punishment. They are not your enemies. Your enemy is the anger that is controlling you. Sit down here and begin to breathe deep and long. Embrace the anger in you and look deeply into its nature. If you can master the anger in you, you can give rise to understanding and love, and you will become fresh. In the future, you will be able to help those people to understand that the information fed to them is wrong; then they will not behave like they are behaving right now. The Buddha did that, Thay did that, and now you also have to do that. Sit down. Sit down right here and practice, my young brother!” The young novice sat down to practice. Those first breaths were loud like a cow rumbling, heavy and laborious, but slowly he calmed down and in the end, he was able to control his mind. A few days later, he said: “Whoops! If I had not practiced that day, if I had used violence to respond to violence, then I would have destroyed the great example set by the Buddha and by Thay, because the Buddha and Thay would never behave like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love, understanding and non-violence are not topics to talk about. They are exercises for us to look deeply into and to practice. There are those who have been practitioners for 20 or 30 years, but when they encounter irritating and provoking situations they cannot resist their anger and fear, and they respond with violent behavior. Amongst you there are those who have practiced for only three or four years, and there are those who have practiced for only six months, yet you are able to behave calmly because you have concrete Dharma practices: recognizing, embracing, and transforming your unwholesome mental formations. As a result, people can see that you are true practitioners, and your Dharma practices are not just for « beginners at a rudimentary level » or only « meditation on the skin, » as some people have criticized. These are Dharma practices that we must believe in one hundred percent. They are our ultimate truths, directly taught by the Buddha in the « Sutra on the Awareness of Breathing. » Thay sees that many venerables, with or without positions in the Buddhist Church, have also recognized that you truly love to learn and to practice, and that you have let go of worldly fame and ambition in order to follow the path of true monastic practitioners. They know that you practice precepts and mindful manners diligently. Thus, they have tried their best to protect you, even though their capacities are limited. Thay recalls that they wrote clearly in one official document: “Prajna Monastery is an establishment that belongs to the Buddhist Church. Whoever practices properly, that person may continue to reside there. Whoever misbehaves and exhibits violence, that person must leave.” Sometimes, through their official writings, these venerables sponsored you so that you could dwell peacefullly under their protection. And recently, they gave orders that violent behaviors must stop, and electricity and water must be reconnected for you. Don’t you know that this is already a lot for these venerables to do? If the situation is not as they hope for, it is because their power is limited. Besides that, there must be other conditions. Once the truth is revealed, wholesome, favorable conditions will come together. In a few years, when it is clear that the presence of Prajna Monastery is not at all dangerous to national security; on the contrary, when many see that it helps to rectify and recover the ethical, moral and cultural values for the country, then that notion, that fear, that suspicion will dissipate, and we will be left in peace to practice and to help others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know that right now, in our country and around the world, everyone knows about Prajna, and everyone is aware of what has been happening? Everyone is able to see your calm and non-violent practice, and everyone is proud of you. The photograph of you sitting still in meditation in the midst of violence and provocation has been sent out widely, and millions of people have viewed it. It is not any different from the photograph of the Most Venerable Quang Duc immolating himself to call for peace in 1963. We have been embraced and protected by many spiritual friends. Thay knows that his children are not worried, because you know that Thay is not worried. You only need to sit very still over there, just like Thay and your brothers and sisters only need to sit very still over here, then with certainty, the thunder will calm, and the clouds will dissolve. Our energy of silence is the energy of understanding and love. This is a Noble Silence, and it is also a Thundering Silence. Even though on the outward appearance, tomorrow we, teacher and disciples, may be in separate places; we will always have each other. The diamond seed is in the heart of every one of you, and in the future, each one of you will become a Fragrant Palm Leaf; each one of you will become a Prajna Monastery. There will be hundreds and thousands of Prajna Monasteries in our homeland and in the world. It is gradually becoming a reality, isn’t it, my children? We are a Sangha. We are not an establishment. Let Thay write down for you a poem of Zen Master Tinh Quang, who lived in the mid 12th century. This poem reflects the freedom and the fearlessness of the Zen Master. When we read it, we also feel that the Zen Master is speaking about our own stance:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Thay Misses The Sangha&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dear Friends and Co-practitioners at the Retreat One Buddha is not enough, Estes Park, CO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dear friends,
&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/one-buddha-is-not-enough-229x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;I am writing to you from the Massachusettes General Hospital in Boston.  I know the Sangha has manifested today in Estes Park.  I miss the Reterat.  I miss the beautiful setting of the REtreat.  Especially I miss the Sangha, I miss you.  I always enjoy sitting with the Sangha, walking with the Sangha, breathing with the Sangha.  The joy of being together, sharing the Dharma and the practice together is always very nourishing and healing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do not suffer, because I know I am taking care of myself.  And taking care of myself is to take care of you.  The doctors here decided that I should stay 14 days here for the treatment of a lung infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Please do not worry.  It is only an infection.  But it has to be treated right away.  My kidneys, my liver, my heart, my digestive tract all function well.  I am given two strong anti-biotics, from I.V. injections per day.  And the clinicians here are monitoring closely the process of treatment.  I am allowed to go out of the hospital to the park nearby one hour per day to do walking meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are almost 1000 of us now practicing together at the Estes Park Retreat.  It must be joyful.  I am confident that our many Dharma teachers, lay and monastics, are conduction the Retreat the best way we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear friends, if you look deeply enough, you will see me in the Retreat, walking with you, sitting with you, breathing with you.  I feel clearly that I am in you and you are in me.  In this Retreat, you will witness to the talent of the Sangha: You will see that Thay is already well continued by the Sangha, and the Presence of the Sangha carries Thay&amp;#39;s presence.  Please let me walk with your strong feet, breathe with your healthy lungs and smile with your beautiful smiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had finished a wonderful and joyful retreat at Stonehill College in the Sate of Massachusettes before Thay went to the Hospital for a check-up.  The doctors said that we should not delay the treatments.  So Thay is doing his best here for you and you are doing your best up there for Tahy.  In that way we can still enjoy our true togetherness.  Please enjoy the retreat for me, and bring home a set of the Dharma talks given at the Stonehill Retreat, especially the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to write to you again in a few days, before the end of  the Retreat,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston August 2009, Yours faithfully,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nhat Hanh&lt;/p&gt;

There is sunshine in Upper Hamlet today. I went for walking meditation down to the Lower Mountain Temple, along the pathway of pines. From the Still Sitting Hut to the pathway of pines, I passed by fields of grass that were covered with oak leaves, especially around Thầy Giác Thanh’s Floating Cloud hut. The carpet of oak leaves was very thick. There were leaves that are still fresh, the color of the robes of the Theravada monks. The trees shed their leaves, making the earth richer; the earth and the tree nurture each other – I saw this very clearly. I walked very slowly, so that I could be in touch with the ultimate dimension with every step, which means to be in touch with limitless time and infinite space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was walking for myself, but I was also walking for my father and mother, for my teacher, my ancestors, the Buddha, and for you. I see no separation between myself and my parents, my ancestors, the Buddha, and you. Everything is present in each mindful step. The gatha “Let the Buddha breathe, let the Buddha walk” is very good. The more I practice, the more effective it is; that’s why I practice it very regularly. This gatha can also be practiced in other positions, like “let the Buddha breathe, let the Buddha sit;” “let the Buddha breathe, let the Buddha work;” or “let the Buddha breathe, let the Buddha brush these teeth.” This practice is just like the practice of recollecting the Buddha’s name. “Buddha” here is not a title; Buddha is a real human being that is breathing, walking, washing dishes, mopping the floor…..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered how recently on the India tour, I practiced “Here is Ấn Độ (India), Ấn Độ (India) is here” instead of “here is Tịnh Độ (the Pure Land), Tịnh Độ (the Pure Land) is here.” When we did walking meditation on Rajpath Street in New Delhi, I practiced this gatha; and at the same time I practiced walking for my father, mother, spiritual ancestors, and for you. I practiced: “The Buddha is going for a walk; the Buddha is enjoying; the Buddha is happy; the Buddha is free. I am going for a walk; I am enjoying…” Then, “my father is going for a walk; my father is enjoying….” When I practiced for you, I invited you to walk with my feet: “I am going for a walk, I am enjoying….” Each and every one of you was present with me during the whole trip in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My children, you are monastics (xuất sĩ) and laypeople (cư sĩ). “Xuất” means to go forth or go out of; not to have a high social position, but to assimilate into the community of monastics. If the sangha needs you to go somewhere then you go; you don’t only have one dwelling place. “Cư” means to dwell; “cư sĩ” also means “xứ sĩ”, those who have not “gone forth” or ordained as monastics, who still have responsibilities towards their parents but also have the opportunity to take part in the practice and be part of the fourfold community. The monastic and lay communities rely on each other, support each other, practice transformation and help living beings. The sangha body is a beautiful community of four integral parts – monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen – “realizing harmony, awareness and liberation…” The civil rights activist Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had hoped to build a community like that: a community that has happiness, brotherhood, and also the capacity to fight for the good of society. He called it the “beloved community.” It’s a pity that he was assassinated in Memphis when he was 39 years old, and that particular beautiful dream of his was never realized. We are more fortunate: we are able to build sanghas everywhere, so that every place will become our homeland. (“The Sangha body is everywhere; my true home is right here.”) We have been able to continue, and to realize, the aspiration of Martin Luther King: cultivating brotherhood in our daily practice, living joyfully and helping others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the last time I met Dr. King, in Switzerland, at the “Pacem In Terris” conference organized by the World Council of Churches in 1968. Dr. King stayed with his assistant on the 11th floor in the big hotel where the conference was taking place. I stayed on the ground floor with just one lay assistant. Dr. King invited me to have breakfast with him so we could talk. Because I was busy with a press conference, I was half an hour late, but Dr. King had kept my breakfast warm. In that meeting, I had the opportunity to tell him: “The friends in Vietnam really support you, and they see you as a living bodhisattva.” He was very happy to hear that. Every time I think back on that meeting, I feel glad I was able to tell him that, because a few months later he was assassinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pine pathway leading to Sơn Hạ temple is one of the most beautiful paths in Plum Village. Have you ever walked on that path with me? The pines were planted to become a forest, in rows, standing next to each other as a sangha body--fresh and green all through the year. There are about 8,000 pine trees in that forest. In the dry season, I usually stop in the middle of the path and sit down on the carpet of pine needles. If there is an attendant with me, then teacher and student have tea together before standing up and continuing the walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hut at Sơn Hạ Temple, where I usually make a fire to receive venerable monks and nuns who come to participate in the Great Ordination Ceremony during the Winter Retreat, used to be a farmer’s family home. Outside it looks very ugly; but the inside has been remodeled in a lovely way and is quite comfortable, especially around the fireplace in the living room. On the mantel above the fireplace there is a calligraphy that says “bois ton thé” – which means, “drink your tea.” On cold and snowy days we have gathered, sometimes 20-30 of us, around that fireplace to drink tea and to tell stories from all over, because everybody has come from different places. “We are birds, flown here from four directions…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to give that hut in Sơn Hạ a name. It’s ugly on the outside, but inside it is very beautiful. I called it “Toadskin Hut.” That’s right! The skin of a toad, peau de crapon in French. A toad’s skin is bumpy and not beautiful at all on the outside, but on the inside it can be very beautiful. When Dung, Brother Pháp Đôn’s father, first came inside the hut he said: “Outside it looks like toad skin, but inside it looks like yellow jewels.” Do you know that sentence? It’s the first line of a riddle. “Outside toad skin, inside yellow jewels. Even from a distance, you’ll smell my fragrance. What am I?” The answer is: a ripe jackfruit. On the outside, the skin of a jackfruit is bumpy like the skin of the toad; but inside, the ripe fruit is yellow and fragrant, and it looks like gold and jewels. And when you walk near a ripe jackfruit, you will smell its fragrance. That riddle may be from around Hue, because it has the three words “thơm lừng lựng” (fragrant from afar). So my hut in Sơn Hạ is toad skin on the outside, but if on the inside it looks like jewels and gold, that is thanks to the hard work of Hieu, the blood brother of Brother Pháp Quan. He has done a lot of work redecorating this place that used to be the home of a poor farmer. I’ve started to like the “Toadskin” name already – don’t you think it’s funny?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the old myths, a young man was walking along some rice fields, saw a toad, and stepped over it. As he stepped down, he heard from behind him the sound of a young woman clearing her throat. Turning around to look, he was surprised to see a beautiful princess. Naturally this young man and the princess started to converse, and at the end he invited her home to introduce her to his parents. He didn’t forget to pick up the toadskin, take it home with him and tear it apart, so this stunningly beautiful princess couldn’t crawl back into her bumpy toad skin. I feel I am as fortunate as that young man. I have met many bumpy toads on my journey; but those toads, after shedding their skins, have become charming princes and drop-dead gorgeous princesses. Every time your bodhicitta manifests, you’ll be as beautiful as princes and princesses. And the image of the sangha climbing the hill of the century is truly a wonderful image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are familiar walking meditation paths that have appeared in my dreams. Paths at the root temple, Tu Hieu, that Thay had trodden when he was still a novice have become legendary paths, and occasionally they appear in my dreams of finding a true home. My children at Prajña have created similar paths, and the stones on those paths have become familiar through the mindful steps of each prince and princess. Fragrant Palm Leaves had paths like that. The Hermitage Among the Clouds also had paths like that. Deer Park has paths like that; and presently at Blue Cliff my spiritual children are using mindful steps to cultivate their own paths like that. The old walking meditation paths at Green Mountain Dharma Center and Maple Forest Monastery are no less beautiful. They made a song: “Together we shall go to visit Green Mountain, climb the immense sky, we shall go the tea house, walk around the pond…” For sure the Pure Land has paths like that, that always help us remember it when we go away. Do you remember the walking meditation path along the creek and through the bamboo forest at the hermitage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This afternoon, sitting in Still Water Meditation Hall, I invited the Buddha to breathe with my lungs. I said: “These are my lungs, but they are also your lungs. Please breathe at your ease. My lungs are still healthy, don’t worry” – and the Buddha breathes happily; both of us breathe happily together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sơn Hạ temple is surrounded by forest, mostly pine trees. It has a stream and a pond. “Sơn Hạ hữu tuyền, trạc chi tắc dũ” is a verse taken from the Kinh Thủy Sám (Healing Water Discourse); it means, “at the foot of the mountain, there is a stream; take the water and wash yourself, and your wounds will heal.” Sơn Hạ temple is at the foot of a great hill. There is a bridge crossing over the stream, at the end of the bridge is a stone engraved with the words “Sơn Hạ hữu tuyền....” in classical Chinese. This great hill is the Thệ Nhật hill; on top of it is Dharma Cloud temple, the Upper Hamlet of Plum Village. Brother Nguyện Hải is the abbot of Dharma Cloud temple, but because he is teaching in Vietnam, Brother Pháp Đôn is presently serving in his place. Brother Pháp Sơn is the abbot of Sơn Hạ temple. He is from Spain and he also has English citizenship, and in addition to Spanish he also speaks English, German and French very well. The layfriends really like the setting of Sơn Hạ temple. This winter there are eighteen lay practitioners praticing there alongside the monks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One time last year during the winter retreat, I played “tour guide” and brought some people up from Sơn Hạ to Dharma Cloud temple via the pine pathway. These “tourists” weren’t any strangers, though. They were professor Hoàng Khôi – Chân Đạo Hành and his wife Chân Tuệ Hương, both of whom are very good students of Thầy. Last winter the two of them came from Sydney to participate in the Winter Retreat in Plum Village, and they stayed in Upper Hamlet. These two lay friends are very good Dharma Teachers. They have transcribed and edited many of Thay’s books in Vietnamese, like Illusionary and Real Happiness, The Liveliness of Meditation Practice, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having them for tea at my Toadskin hut in Sơn Hạ, I led them along the pine pathway up to Upper Hamlet. I said to them: “Imagine you are going to Dharma Cloud for the first time. I am taking you to see a Zen master in a thatched hut, the Sitting Still Hut on the eastern side of the Thệ Nhật hill, close to Dharma Cloud Temple. If you know how to take each step up this hill with mindfulness, then you will have more opportunities to meet this teacher, because he usually pratices walking meditation by himself in the hills, sometimes picking wild greens, sometimes gathering medicine (Sư thê dược khứ). There are times when he spends the whole day in the forest and no one knows where he sits, not even his novice attendants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That day the rain had just stopped. The sun was shining beautifully on the leaves still glistening with raindrops, just like jewels catching the morning light. I stopped walking and put out my hand to catch a drop of water from a pine needle; the glistening water fell onto my finger in one round drop. I told Professor Chân Đạo Hành to put out his hand to recieve this jewel, and I put it on his palm. His hands had been in his pockets, so they were still dry and warm, and when the jewel was placed on his hand it was still a whole drop. I also “picked” a jewel like that for Chân Tuệ Hương. The Earth and sky are so wonderful. Every moment is a precious jewel containing sky, water, clouds, earth. With just one mindful breath, so many miracles manifest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/legendary-paths-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking meditation is like that. Each step is a realization; each step is joy; each step is nourishment and healing. When we started up the hill, I stopped, pointed up to a corner of the hill and told them, “A short distance from here, you shall see the Sitting Still Hut. Maybe the master is sitting there.” And when Sitting Still hut was visible, I stopped again, pointed to the hut so they could see it, and invited them to breathe and smile. In reality, both of them had seen Sitting Still hut many times already, and many times drank tea with me in that Hut; but this time they were using a new set of eyes to look and explore something new. The three of us were like people out of a legend, looking for a Zen master in the mountains, not knowing whether the conditions will be right for them to meet the master or not. (There are thousands of people who have been to Upper Hamlet, from so many countries; but how many were received as guests by the hermit at the Sitting Still Hut? Or how many have been received as the guests of the hermit at the Deep Listening Hut at our Từ Hiếu root temple?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year during winter retreat, Brother Pháp Tri was my attendant at Still Sitting hut, under the guidance of his elder Brother Mãn Tuệ. When Brother Pháp Tri came back from his mindful manners class, not seeing me, he prepared to go into the hills to search for me. Right at that moment, I arrived with my two tourists. I was still playing “tour guide” and I asked the novice: “Is the master in the hut?” The novice looked confused, and he didn’t know how to answer. I went on: “Or is the master not back from gathering herbal medicine on the mountain?” Now the novice understood. He answered: “Dear honored guest, my teacher is almost back from the mountain. I would like to invite everyone to come into the hut to drink tea while waiting for the master.” At Vietnam Temple in Los Angeles, there is a calligraphy I offered to Venerable Mãn Giác. It is a translation of a poem written by Giã Đảo from the Đương dynasty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the pine tree the novice said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“the master just left to gather herbal medicine on this mountain
but because of the thick fog you cannot see him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the attendant knew where his master was sitting and at which peak, but he answered in that way because he didn’t want his master to be disturbed by the visitor. He didn’t want to have to go search for the master, so the master could be left alone to sit in peace. Occasionally fog envelops Thệ Nhật mountain, but not as much as at Kim Sơn Monastery in Northern California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pine path has become a legend too, don’t you see? But what path that we tread hasn’t? Like the walking meditation path to the creek at Prajña. We have walked that path many times with such steps, do you remember, my children? The path leading the to Thousand Lotus Petal mountain in Deer Park – how many times have we climbed that mountain? How many times have we sat on those boulders at the top of the peak, looking down at the valley and at Escondido covered with fog? The walking meditation path starting from the Buddha Hall garden in Từ Hiếu down to the half-moon pond, around the morning star pond, accross the three-door gate up Dương Xuân Hill or towards the patriarch’s stupas – that path has become legendary, and appeared in my dreams over the forty years I was away from Vietnam. The walking meditation paths in Lower Hamlet and New Hamlet also carry two decades of our footprints, and every time we go far away, we always miss them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have printed our Buddha footsteps on walking meditation paths at Estes Park in the Rocky Mountains; on the walkways of Stonehill College; on the grounds of the University of California at Santa Barbara; at MacArthur Park in Los Angeles; on main roads of big cities like Frankfurt, Rome, Amsterdam, Paris, New York, New Delhi, Hanoi, etc. I remember when we did walking meditaion by Hoàn Kiếm Lake, as a sangha of monastic and lay practitioners of 41 nationalities. We made steps of peace and freedom by the lake, crossing Thê Húc Bidge into Ngọc Sơn Shrine. The locals were surprised to see a group of people walking with freedom, as business-less people amidst the bustle of Vietnam’s capital, where everyone seems to be preoccupied and in a hurry. Upon seeing such a group of people, some said they rediscovered the roots of their culture and their true home. We walked the same way in Trung Hậu, Đồng Đắc, Sóc Sơn, Bằng A, Văn Miếu, Hoa Lư, Tát Diệm, Diệu Đế, Thuyền Tôn, Linh Mụ, Linh Ứng, Tam Thai Chúc Thánh, Mỹ Sơn, Cam Ranh, Thập Tháp, Nguyên Thiều, Giác Viên, Giác Lâm, Ấn Quang, Hoằng Pháp, and Pháp Vân. Everywhere is the holy land to us. Any place can be our true home, when we know how to stop and live in awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year 2008 will end in a few weeks. Sitting here, writing this end-of-the-year letter for my spiritual children, I feel a lot of warmth, as if I am sitting with you all. New Hamlet will host Christmas this year, Lower Hamlet will host the New Year’s celebration, and Upper Hamlet will host the Vietnamese Lunar New Year, the Year of the Ox. In this winter’s New Lotus Season Great Ordination ceremony, about twenty-seven people will receive transmission of the Dharma lamp, and Brother Pháp Hữu will be one of them. Little Huỳnh Thế Nhiệm came to Plum Village for the first time when he was seven years old, and he came back many times after that. Nhiệm ordained at the age of twelve, in February 2002. Now Nhiệm will receive the lamp and become a Dharma Teacher. That is Brother Pháp Hữu. During this winter retreat, Pháp Hữu has seven lay mentees. They are very happy to have such a young mentor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My baby monks and nuns are now all grown up! Other than Brother Pháp Hữu, there are Brother Pháp Chiếu and Sisters Mật Nghiem, Đàn Nghiêm and Mẫn Nghiêm also mentoring our lay friends. Sister Mẫn Nghiêm received the lamp transmission last year in the Earth Refreshing Great Ordination ceremony, becoming the youngest Dharma Teacher in Plum Village. Sister Mẫn Nghiêm met me for the first time when she was five years old. She came to Plum Village to ordain when she was twelve. Hạ Thoại Mỹ Quyên was her name. When she was sixteen she read my book Speaking to Twenty-Year-Olds and she promised herself that when I turned eighty she would write a book for me with the title, Speaking to Eighty-Year-Olds. Quyên did write that book when she turned twenty; it was 300 pages long, and I still have it in my Fragrant Source hermitage. I am the only one allowed to read it, Sister Mẫn Nghiêm has told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pháp Hữu will become a young Dharma Teacher. In his ten years together with me, we have never been upset with each other. The connection between us is very good. Pháp Hữu has become one of the best attendants – most attentive, no less than Brother Pháp Niệm; very organized. He doesn’t wait for me to tell him what I need. One time I said to Pháp Hữu: “In the past when the Venerable Ananda was attending the Buddha, he was only as good as you are being my attendant now.” Nhiệm humbly answered, “But I don’t have good memory like the Venerable Ananda.” I chuckled and said, “You don’t need Venerable Ananda’s memory, because you already have an iPod in my shoulder bag.” Master and student looked at each other and giggled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I am thinking of snow. Snow is falling right now in Waldbröl, at the EIAB. Last week, Sister Sông Nghiêm called and told me that snow was falling and that it was ten inches deep on the ground. The scenery in Waldbröl is now wonderfully beautiful, and she invited me to come over there to play with them. But I am there right now, do you not see that, my children? I am also right now at Blue Cliff, Deer Park, Maple Village, Lotus Bud, Magnolia Village, Prajna, Từ Hiếu, Hohenau, Source of Compassion, and many other places! You have to be able to see me right there where you are sitting or standing. Do the younger ones still remember Brother Pháp Lâm’s riddle? I am not only in India. Have you heard the Zen master Vô Ngôn Thông say, “Here is India; India is here” (Tây Thiên thử độ, thử độ Tây Thiên) yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the hammock that hangs among the trees behind the Insitute. Before going there, I had written a letter for my children in Germany. I asked anyone who has a hammock to bring it for me to borrow. I would hang the hammock in the apple orchard and sit on the hammock to play with my children, celebrating the new Insitute. I don’t know who passed on that letter, but when I arrived at the Institute, my attendants reported that a total of 149 hammocks that been brought. Next summer, we will have more than enough opportunities to practice hammock meditation over there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing letters for my children, I don’t know how much is enough. I will stop here. I will see you again on the eve of the Lunar New Year, during the poetry sharing. I wish everyone much happiness and progress in building brotherhood and sisterhood.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;The Mountain Rock Cliff Robe&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Qua_duong_XH.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;Last night while sleeping here Thầy had a dream. He saw that he was climbing a mountain with the Buddha and with little Hải Triều Âm (Sound of the Rising Tide). At that time, it was about 2 am in the morning which is 8 o’clock in the morning in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the dream, the Buddha was still very young, in his sixties. Thầy was in his fifties and Hải Triều Âm was a teenager. Lord Buddha did not look chubby and jolly like Thầy Lệ Trang, but rather skinny and tall like Thầy Pháp Hộ. He climbed the mountain with ease, Thầy followed the Buddha very closely and climbed pretty well himself. Little Hải Triều Âm was not carrying any cushion or tea or hot water. He just carried a brown shoulder bag which may not have contained anything. The Buddha did not bring his bowl and Thầy didn’t either. Even little Hải Triều Âm didn’t bring his bowl. Thầy and little Hải Triều Âm were supposed to play the role of Buddha’s attendants. How could Thầy and little Hải Triều Âm be as good as Thầy Ananda because the two of them didn’t help the Buddhha with anything? They didn’t even carry his robe and bowl!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mountain which the Buddha, Thầy and little Hải Triều Âm were climbing looked a little like the Vulture Peak, but it was not Vulture Peak. On this mountain as well as grey cliffs of rock, there were also monolithic brown rocks that were much harder to climb than Vulture Peak. Once you had climbed up one rock, there came another. The mountain rocks appeared constantly in their infinite massiveness. Thầy didn’t feel tired and it is quite possible that little Hải Triều Âm also didn’t feel tired. It’s a great happiness to climb the mountain with the World Honored One, how could we feel tired, my dear children?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real life little Hải Triều Âm is the boy TÝ in the book “The Young Guava Leaf” and the book “The Bamboo of One Million Internodes”. He is now about 40 years old, married and has a Ph.D degree in Law. In the dream Hải Triều Âm was only twelve, still very innocent and attentive as in the days he lived in the Walnut Building, Lower Hamlet, when Plum Village had only just begun. He wore a small grey novice robe and carried a brown cloth bag. Thầy wore a brown robe and what was the most fascinating thing was that the Buddha also wore a brown robe, not a copper color sanghati like the one of the Theravada monks. It looked like the Buddha also enjoyed wearing the brown robe of the monks and nuns of Vietnam. Or perhaps the Buddha just wanted to be a good companion and did the same as Thầy and Hải Triều Âm and that is why he was climbing the mountain in a brown robe. In Plum Village there are monks of Thai, Japanese, Korean, Indonesian, Lao, Sri Lankan or Cambodian tradition. After living for a time with the Plum Village monks in their residence in the Upper Hamlet, brothers like Thầy Pitaya, Thầy Shariputra, Thầy Doji, Thầy Ananda and Novice Học Hiền put away their sanghati in order to enjoy wearing the same brown robes as our brothers do. They only put on their sanghati in ceremonies of recitation or transmission of the precepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the dream there was a moment when the Buddha stopped and sat down alongside a small stream that was running from a source in the cliff. Thầy and Hải Triều Âm sat down a little to one side in attendance. Little Hải Triều Âm was very at ease. He joined his palms, looked up and addressed the Buddha:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lord Buddha, my teacher said that the brown color of the robe (áo tràng) that the monks and nuns in Vietnam wear, expresses the simplicity of the monastic life and also the strength of the mind of love. I also love this simple brown color very much. Why do we call it áo tràng? What does áo tràng mean, Lord Buddha?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Honored One looked at the mountain range above them, then he kindly addressed Hải Triều Âm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You may very well call the áo tràng ‘the Mountain Cliff Robe’, or ‘the Mountain Rock Robe’ or ‘the Mountain Rock Cliff Robe’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thầy’s dream ended suddenly after the Buddha’s words. On waking Thầy felt some little regret because the dream was so beautiful. Thầy lay there, following his breathing and tried to recapitulate the little details of the dream. Thầy can only guarantee that the words of the Buddha which you read above are about seventy per cent correct in detail. In fact it seemed that the Buddha only used one name for the áo tràng which was either ‘the Mountain Cliff Robe’, or ‘the Mountain Rock Robe’ or ‘the Mountain Rock Cliff Robe’. What we can be sure about is that the name of the robe only had two words either ‘mountain rock’ or ‘rock mountain’ or ‘mountain cliff’ or ‘rock cliff’, it could not have been Mountain Rock Cliff Robe, because an epithet of three words is too long. What is recorded is in accord with the meaning and spirit of the Buddha’s words rather than an exact record of each word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Hải Triều Âm was a novice; he wore the grey novice robe, called the color of the smoke of incense, or of mist. That is the color of the mountain rocks of Vulture Peak. That grey color is not really the blue color. It is just the grey color of the mist. This color belongs to the novice robe and the color of the uniform of the Buddhist Youth Association. It represents the purity and lightness of the incense smoke, the mist, and the power of the forests and mountains. The Grey Mountain (Nui Lam) is the sacred area of Vietnam where the hero Lê Lợi, who wore a simple cloth robe, prepared for the removal of the Ming army from Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A song about Núi Lam goes “The sun rises and the mist evaporates into the mountain clouds.” So grey is also the color of strength. The brown robe which the monks and nuns in Vietnam have worn for the past two thousand years also expresses the wholesome and frugal life of the Vietnamese country people. The country people in Vietnam enjoy wearing brown. The elderly as well as the young village girls look beautiful in their traditional light brown tunic. The quiet and deep brown color is both simple and imposing. Thầy had often told little Hải Triều Âm that his monastic disciples should try to preserve the brown color of the Vietnamese Buddhist tradition. They only need to put on the yellow sanghati during ceremonies of recitation or transmission of the precepts. Little Hải Triều Âm had remembered this and in his child’s language had brought up the matter with the Buddha during the climb up the mountain. At this moment of writing to you, my beloved children, I feel very happy as I recall the image of the Buddha wearing a brown robe. The Buddha just wanted to go along with us in wearing the brown robe. It is Thay’s idea that from now on we may call the grey áo tràng Grey Mountain Robe and the brown áo tràng Mountain Rock Robe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our Deer Park and Blue Cliff monasteries there are steep mountain rocks and the monks and the nuns often like to climb them. Ascending a rock cliff is a very Zen phrase. It means that the cliff is not easy to climb, but once you are on top of it, you will feel so happy. The monastic path is also a difficult one, but very beautiful. What is wonderful is that we are climbing the mountain together with the Buddha. The poet Nguyển Công Trứ sometimes wanted to drop everything and just climb the mountain. He spoke of a pine tree growing up solid on the mountain ridge, perching independently from a surrounding area. That is the image of an authentic monk or nun. He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the next lifetime instead of being a human,
    Let me be a pine tree standing and rustling under the sky,
    In the place of steep rock cliffs
    Whoever can bear the cold may enjoy climbing with the pine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Thầy and his disciples enjoy climbing the rocks on the mountains, but we still want to be human in the next lifetimes. The chant Taking Refuge in the book “Chanting from the Heart” carries the words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the next lifetime may we again be born as humans
    And may we encounter the Dharma and live a life of true practice.
    May we be guided on the path of practice by an enlightened teacher.
    Equipped with faith, may we be ordained into the monastic Sangha.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thầy is very happy whenever he remembers that he and his disciples are climbing the hill of the twenty first century together. We have been climbing this hill for nearly ten years now. In the year 2050, we shall stand on the peak and look down at the beautiful scenery which will be no less beautiful than the scene from the Vulture Peak. Thầy wrote to Thầy Giác Thanh, the first abbot of the Deer Park Monastery, a gatha just before he passed away and a couple of parallel verses sometimes after:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An autumn leaf falls. Still you continue to climb with us the hill of the century
    Thousands of daffodils bloom. Heaven and earth keep singing together the song of no birth and no death”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two lines have been engraved at the memorial stupa of Thầy Giác Thanh on a steep rock cliff in the Deer park Monastery, U.S.A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Zen tradition there is a very famous book that expounds Zen koans. It is called Blue Cliff Records (Bích Nham Lục). Bích is blue, Nham is a cliff. The Yên Tử Mountain where the Great Bamboo Forest Master (King Trần Nhân Tông) practiced, taught and realized the path is also a sacred place, full of grey mist. The color of our robes comes from a very long tradition. So try to preserve these two colors grey and brown as the colors of your robes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Prajna monastery there are no steep cliffs. As teacher and disciples we have climbed the hill that goes down to the stream many times and each time has brought us much happiness. The monastic path is not a smooth highway but a cliff we have to climb. And you have climbed the mountain cliffs very well. Little Hải Triều Âm has climbed the mountain with Lord Buddha very well. Thầy has also climbed well. We are very happy even though we still encounter difficulties. All my beloved children, whether you are monastic or lay, whether you have come to practice at Prajna monastery, the Root Temple, Blue Cliff Monastery, Deer Park Monastery, Định Quán, Trúc Lâm, Diệu Trạm…. , you all are my little Hải Triều Âm, and you all still have been able to preserve the mind of clarity and purity of a young person with the deep aspiration to serve all beings. Even if you are a lay practitioner, you may like to wear these two colors, grey and brown. The way we walk, stand, lie down and sit mindfully, the way we practice to build brotherhood and sisterhood, is what helps people in society to recognize who we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are the continuation of Lord Buddha and the Patriarchs who include: the great Bamboo Forest Master, Linji, Liễu Quán, and Nhất Định. We are going as a river, and at the same time we are climbing the hill of the century with much happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thầy is staying now in the European Institute of Applied Buddhism. Many young Germans are coming to practice. On 8th May 2009, the Mountain Rock Cliff sangha will be invited by the mayor of the city of Cologne for an official welcome. Thầy’s attendants, Brs. Pháp Hy and Pháp Hữu will tell you all more about what we are doing here in the heart of Europe these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well known as a true practitioner,
    He has done what needed to be done.
    As soon as the stupa stands of the mountain ridge,
    The sound of children’s laughter rings out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

			&lt;h1&gt;Sitting in the Autumn Breeze&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dear Spiritual Family,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://new.plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/thay-bcm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;Blue Cliff in autumn is very beautiful. Forests are adorned by the ripening leaves. Today, starting at 11 a.m., retreatants from everywhere will come to attend a retreat with the topic Sitting in the Autumn Breeze. A great number of people signed up, but we could not accommodate all of them, so we had to turn down many people. Our monastic brothers and sisters and lay friends feel very bad about this, but there is no other way. This is the first largest retreat in Blue Cliff. Everyone wants to come practice with the Sangha and, at the same time, “check out” the new monastery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the afternoon of October 9th 2007, Time Magazine came to interview Thầy about the events that have been taking place in Burma and about the issue on global warming. The interview will be on line (Read interview). About Burma, Thầy said that the Burmese monks have been courageous in standing up to show the people the way to human rights and democracy. They prove to be worthy spiritual leaders of the country. A country and a nation cannot be without a spiritual dimension. A human life must also have a spiritual dimension. Without a spiritual dimension, we will not have the capacity to confront suffering, to transform suffering and to offer anything to life. A person without a spiritual path is a person walking in darkness. With a path, we are no longer afraid or worried. The Burmese monks have shown the way to their country and their nation.  Even though they face oppression, imprisonment and even death, their minds are at peace, because they have been able to do what they have vowed to do: to provide their country and their nation spiritual leadership. They have fulfilled their responsibility. Every time people of every social class in Burma think about these monks, they will feel touched: this energy of love and faith that will be their motivating force, nourishing actions that bring human rights and democracy to their country. The world is supporting Burma, just as the world supported the struggle for human rights and freedom of the Buddhist and Vietnamese people in the 1960’s under the Ngo Dinh Diem regime.  It was not one Buddhist practitioner who stood up but all Buddhist practitioners stood up together at the same time. Now it is the same thing in Burma. It is not one monk that has stood up, but all the monks have stood up. This is true spiritual leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thầy also told Time Magazine: All over the world we are also waiting for the spiritual leaders in the United States to stand up to provide that spiritual leadership, in order to end quickly the suffering and loss of lives in Iraq. Spiritual leaders should stand up simultaneously with a clear voice to help wake the people up and show them the way. When the people have a clear vision, and the people have made up their minds, then the government has no choice but to follow. The war in Vietnam ended because of the awakening of the American people at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 6th 2007, when we had a day of mindfulness for 1,800 psychotherapists in the University of California in Los Angeles, the monks and nuns of Deer Park and Plum Village put on the Sanghati robes after the Dharma talk, chanted May the Day Be Well and evoked the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara to send energy to the monks and lay practitioners in Burma. The governor of California and his wife also came to attend that whole day of mindfulness. Before chanting, the monks and nuns declared that Plum Village and Deer Park communities wanted to express our solidarity with monastic and lay practitioners in Burma. Afterwards, a motion with two points was read out loud to the audience. The first point is that, we proposed the United Nations to send immediately to Burma a fact finding mission consisting of members of different countries, like the one the U.N. sent to Vietnam in September 1963. The second point is that, we ask the International Olympic Committee to work with China, so that China could put pressure on the Burmese army leaders in the direction of bringing democracy to the country. Everyone participated in the 3-day conference for the psychotherapist in UCLA stood up in that moment to express their support for this motion, including the governor of California. News reporters were present. The conference hall was absolutely quiet, generating a powerful collective energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About global warming, Thầy recounted to Times Magazine the story about the couple who ate their son’s flesh – the story told by the Buddha in the Son’s Flesh Sutra. This couple, with their little child, on their way seeking asylum had to cross the desert. Due to a lack of geographical knowledge, they ran out of food, while they were only half way through the desert. They realized that all three of them would die in the desert, and they had no hope to get to the country on the other end of the desert to seek asylum. Finally, they made the decision to kill their little son. Each day they ate a small morsel of his flesh, in order to have enough energy to move on, and they carried the rest of their son’s flesh on their shoulders, so that it could continue to dry in the sun. Each time when they finished eating a morsel of their son’s flesh, the couple looked at each other and asked: “Where is our beloved child now?”  Having told this tragic story, the Buddha looked at the monks and asked: “Do you think that this couple was happy to eat their son’s flesh?”  “No, World Honored One. The couple suffered when they had to eat their son’s flesh,” the monks answered. The Buddha taught: “Dear friends, we have to practice eating in such a way that we can retain  compassion in our hearts. We have to eat in mindfulness. If not, we may be eating the flesh of our own children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNESCO reported that each day about 40,000 children die because of hunger or lack of nutrition. Meanwhile, corn and wheat are largely grown to feed livestock (cows, pigs, chickens, etc.) or to produce alcohol. Over 80 percent of corn and over 95 percent of oats produced in the United States are for feeding livestock. The world’s cattle alone consume a quantity of food equivalent to the caloric needs of 8.7 billion people, more than the entire human population on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating meat and drinking alcohol with mindfulness, we will realize that we are eating the flesh of our own children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) began an in-depth assessment of the various significant impacts of the world’s livestock sector on the environment. Its report, titled Livestock’s Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options, was released on November 29th 2006. Henning Steinfeld, chief of FAO’s Livestock Information and Policy Branch and senior of the report, in the executive summary, asserts that: “The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change, air pollution, water shortage, water pollution and loss of biodiversity. Livestock’s contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency” (page XX)1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Land degradation: Presently, livestock production accounts for 70 percent of all agriculture land and 30 percent of the land surface of the planet. Forests are cleared to create new pastures, and it is a major driver of deforestation. For example, in Latin America some 70 percent of former forests in the Amazon have been turned over to grazing (page XXI)1. From these figures, we can see that the livestock business has destroyed hundreds of millions acres of forest all over the world to grow crops and to create pastureland for farm animals. Moreover, when the forests are destroyed, enormous amounts of carbon dioxide stored in trees are released into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change: The livestock sector has major impacts on the atmosphere and climate. It is responsible for “18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions measured in carbon dioxide equivalent, which is a higher share than transport.”2 This means that raising animals for food generates more greenhouse gases than all the cars and trucks in the world combined. The livestock sector accounts for 9 percent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. It also emits 37 percent of anthropogenic methane, most of that from enteric fermentation by ruminants. This is an enormous amount, because every pound of methane is twenty three times as effective as carbon dioxide is at trapping heat in our atmosphere (23 times the global warming potential [GWP] of carbon dioxide). The meat, egg, and dairy industries are also responsible for the emission of 65 percent of anthropogenic nitrous oxide, most of that from manure. Nitrous oxide is about 300 times more potent as a global warming gas than carbon dioxide (296 times the GWP of carbon dioxide). It is also responsible for about two-third (64 percent) of anthropogenic ammonia emissions, which contribute largely to acid rain and accidification of ecosystem (page XXI)1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water scarcity and water pollution: More than half of all the water consumed in the U.S. is used to raise animals for food. It requires 2,500 gallons of water to produce a pound of meat. Meanwhile, it takes only 25 gallons of water to produce a pound of grain. Livestock in the United States produce an enormous amount of animal excrement, 130 times more than human excrement; each second the animals release 97,000 pounds of feces. “Most of the water used for livestock drinking and servicing returns to the environment in the form of manure and wastewater. Livestock excreta contain a considerable amount of nutrients [nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium], drug residues, heavy metals and pathogens” (page 136)1. These waste products enter streams and rivers, polluting water sources and causing disease outbreaks that affect all species.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the Buddha cautioned us, we are eating the flesh of our children and grandchildren. We are eating the flesh of our mothers and our fathers. We are eating our own planet earth. The Son’s Flesh Sutra needs to be available for the whole human race to learn and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.N.’s recommendation is clear: “The environment impact per unit of livestock production must be cut by half, just to avoid increasing the level of damage beyond its present level,” (page XX)1.  We need to reduce at least 50 percent of the meat industry products, and that we must consume 50 percent less meat. The U.N. also reports that even if cattle-rearing is reduced by 50 percent, we still need to use new technology to help the rest of cattle-rearing create less pollution, such as choosing animal diets that can reduce enteric fermentation and consequent methane emissions, etc. Urgent action must be taken at the individual and collective levels. As a spiritual family and a human family, we can all help avert global warming with the practice of mindful eating. Going vegetarian may be the most effective way to fight global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buddhist practitioners have practiced vegeterianism over the last 2000 years. We are vegeterian with the intention to nourish our compassion towards the animals. Now we also know that we eat vegeterian in order to protect the earth, preventing the greenhouse effect from causing her serious and irreversible damage. In the near future, when the greenhouse effect becomes severe, all species will suffer. Millions of people will die, and sea levels will rise and flood cities and land. Many life-threatening diseases will result, and all species will suffer the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both monastic practitioners and lay people practice vegeterianism. Even though the number of lay practitioners who are 100 percent vegeterian is not as many as monastic practitioners, but they practice eating vegeterian meals either for 4 days or 10 days each month. Thầy believes that it is not so difficult to stop eating meat, when we know that we are saving the planet by doing so. Lay communities should be courageous and give rise to the commitment to be vegetarian, at least 15 days each month. If we can do that, we will feel a sense of well-being. We will have peace, joy, and happiness right from the moment we make this vow and commitment. During the retreats organized in the United States this year, many American Buddhist practitioners have made the commitment to stop eating meat or to eat 50 percent less meat. This is a result of their awakening, after they have listened to the Dharma talks on the greenhouse effect. Let us take care of our Mother Earth. Let us take care of all species, including our children and grandchildren. We only need to be vegeterian, and we can already save the earth. Being vegeterian here also means that we do not consume dairy and egg products, because they are products of the meat industry. If we stop consuming, they will stop producing. Only collective awakening can create enough determination for action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This December 2007, Deer Park will have 100 percent electrical power generated from solar energy for the monastery use. All of our monasteries, in the Plum Village tradition in Europe and North America, have also been practicing no car day once a week, and thousands of our friends are also practicing with us. We have begun to use less cars and to use electric cars and vege-cars (run on vegetable oil). These cars can help reduce 50 percent the amount of carbon dioxide released. Buying a Prius Toyota, which uses half gas and half electricity, we can prevent about 1 ton of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere each year. However, according to the University of Chicago, “being a vegan is more effective in the fight against global warming; a vegan prevents approximately 1.5 fewer tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere each year than a meat-eater does….You could spend more than $20,000 on a Prius and still emit 50 percent more carbon dioxide than you would if you just gave up eating meat and other animal products” (Fight Global Warming by Going Vegetarian)3. Do you see that, my dear spiritual family? Being vegeterian is already enough to save the world. Who amongst us has not experienced the delicious taste of vegeterian foods? Only when we are too used to eating meat we cannot see this truth.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This evening when we begin the retreat, everyone will be informed that we will not use dairy and egg products during the whole retreat. From now on, all of our retreats and, of course, all of our practice centers in Asia, Europe, and North America will be conducted like that. Thầy trusts that lay practitioners will understand and support wholeheartedly. Our present practice is to help everyone become aware of the danger of global warming, in order to help save Mother Earth and all species. We know that if there is no collective awakening, then the earth and all species will not have a chance to be saved. Our daily life has to show that we are awake.4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 2nd 2007, at the University of San Diego, Thầy talked about the worry, fear, and despair in relationship to the danger of global warming. The number of people becoming ill due to worry, fear, and despair is increasing each day. They realize that if humans continue to live in ambition, hatred, and ignorance, then the earth and all species will not have an opportunity to escape from this danger. This realization and fear may overwhelm and paralyze many people, and there will be those of us who die from mental illness, before the danger of global warming take place fully. In the Dharma talk, Thầy offered the practice taught by the Buddha: to acknowledge and accept the truth and not run away from it.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddha has taught us to practice looking directly into the seeds of fear in us, instead of trying to cover them up or running away from them.  This is the practice of the five rememberances.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) I will have to grow old. 
2) I will have to get sick. 
3) I will have to die. 
4) One day I will have to lose the things I cherish today, and the people I love today. 
5) When my body disintegrates, I cannot bring anything with me except my actions of body, speech and mind -  they are the only inheritance that I can bring with me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we can practice accepting these truths in this way, we will have peace, and we will have the capacity to live healthy and compassionately - no longer causing suffering to ourselves and to others. When people with cancer or AIDS are first diagnosed and told that they only have 3 months or half a year to live, they often react with anger, denial, and despair in the beginning. They cannot accept it. However, once they can accept the truth, they begin to have peace. When they have peace, they will have the opportunity to practice living “deeply” every moment of their daily lives. As a result, they have the chance to live longer, even 15 years more. We have the example of sister Dam Nguyen from Hanoi. She came to Plum Village one year with the intention to live with Thầy and the Sangha for a few months, then she would return to Hanoi to die. The doctor told her that she could only live 3-4 more months. When she arrived at Plum Village, sisters suggested that she went to see a doctor, but she refused to.  She did not feel the need to see a doctor. She accepted her death, and she lived wholeheartedly every moment she had with the Sangha during those three months.  When her visa was about to expire, she bade farewell to the Sangha. An older sister suggested she see a doctor “just to see” what had happened to her cancer. Sister Dam Nguyen agreed, in order to please that sister. The doctor informed her that all the metastatic sites in her body had receded to one place, and that she was doing very well. Our sister went back to Hanoi with great joy. It has been 14 years since she left Plum Village for Hanoi, and she continues to live.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddha taught that all phenomena are impermanent; there is birth, then there is death. Our civilization is also like that. In the history of the earth, many civilizations have ended. If our modern civilization is destroyed, it also follows the law of impermanence. If our human race continues to live in ignorance and in the bottomless pit of greed as at present, then the destruction of this civilization is not very far away. We have to accept this truth, just like we accept our own death. Once we can accept it, we will not react with anger, denial, and despair anymore. We will have peace. Once we have peace, we will know how to live so that the earth has a future; so that we can come together in the spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood and apply the modern technology available to us, in order to save our beloved green planet. If not, we will die from mental anguish, before our civilization actually terminates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mother, The Earth, the green planet has suffered from her children’s violent and ignorant ways of consuming. We have destroyed our Mother Earth like a type of bacterium or virus destroying the human body, because Mother Earth is also a body. Of course, there are bacteria that are beneficial to the human body. Trillions of these bacteria are present in us, especially in our digestive systems (known as intestinal normal flora). They protect the body and help generate enzymes necessary to us. Similarly, the human species can also be a living organism that has the capacity to protect the body of Mother Earth, if the human species wakes up and knows to live with responsibility, compassion and loving kindness. Buddhism came to life, so that we learn to live with responsibility and compassion and loving kindness. We have to see that we inter-are with our Mother Earth, that we live with her and die with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother Earth has gone through re-birth many times. After the great flood caused by global warming takes place, perhaps only a very small portion of the human race will survive. The earth will need over a million years to recuperate and put on a new whole, beautiful green coat, and another human civilization will begin. That civilization will be the continuation of our civilization. To the human species, one million years is a very long time, but to the earth and in geological time, one million years is nothing at all; it is only a short period of time. Ultimately, all birth and death are only superficial phenomena. No-birth and no-death are the true nature of all things. This is the teaching of the Middle Way in Buddhism. This letter is already long, so Thầy does not wish to expound on this teaching. The retreat has begun, and in another half an hour, Thầy will join the Sangha. Thầy wishes all of you peace and deep practice.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With love and trust,
Thầy&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Answers of Ven. Thich Nhat Hanh to Questions from Publishers Weekly Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;elements-of-prayer&quot;&gt;Elements of Prayer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Some Christians -- those who think of God as someone external and powerful and transcendent -- would be surprised to know that Buddhists pray. What would you say to them?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe Christians and Buddhists understand differently what prayer is. But to begin with, I would say that when we talk of praying, we think of the one who practices praying, the one to whom we address the prayer, and the one we pray for as three persons. And the one we pray for may be ourselves, we pray for our own well-being, but we can always distinguish three persons: the one who prays, the one to whom we address our prayer and the one we pray for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To say that Buddhists do not address their prayer to an external person or personal force does not seem to be correct. Praying is also asking for help, and in the Buddhist tradition, we ask the Sangha to help us; we ask the Buddha to help us. The one who is asking, the one who is praying, is the starting point. That person has to see things clearly enough, has to be calm and serene enough, to ask for help; and first of all he or she should be truly there, concentrated, with a desire, an intention. This is the basic condition for the effectiveness of prayer. The one who prays should be truly there, established in the here and now, having a very clear intention, a very clear desire as to whom he or she will pray, and for whom he or she will pray. If the one who prays can put himself or herself in that situation, much has already been done. That person already has begun to generate the energy of prayer, because he or she is truly present in the here and now with concentration, with mindfulness and intention. If that does not happen, well, nothing will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the one to whom he or she prays should be known to him or to her, and not just an idea of a person. If you pray to the Buddha, you should know who the Buddha is, and not just have a number of ideas of the Buddha. If you know who the Buddha is, prayer will be effective. If you feel that the Buddha is fully present in the here and the now, that you have the capacity of touching him or her, then the prayer will be effective. You know that the Buddha is there also within you, in the form of mindfulness, compassion, concentration; so the Buddha is no longer an idea but a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you pray to your father to ask him to help. Your father: you know who he is. Your father lived long, let’s say to be 90 years old, and the cells of his body are still in you. So when you address your father -- “Daddy, help me” -- you touch your father in a most concrete way; you don’t just touch an idea. Father isn’t an idea. You are the continuation of your father. Suppose someone tells you that you are suspected to have cancer. You can call for your father to help: “Daddy, I know that you are solid, your cells are so wonderful, and they are in me; please come and help me.” And then you feel the response of your father right away in your body. Your father says, “I am here. Don’t worry, my child. We have very solid cells. They know how to replicate. Don’t worry.” When you pray like that, you get in touch with your father and you can see the effect of the prayer right away. If you have a grandmother, a grandfather who was solid, you know that the one you pray to is there always in you and around you. So in that kind of practice, you see that your father, your mother, your grandpa, they are still there in their new manifestations. We are not addressing our prayer to someone or something that is not real, that does not exist, but to a reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true with Buddha or Jesus. According to our insight, the Buddha continues, Jesus also continues in their new forms. And if you are a Buddhist practitioner, you continue the Buddha; so the Buddha as the object of your prayer is a reality, and not just an idea. That practice relies on the basic insight that nothing is ever lost. Your father is still there, your grandmother is still there, Buddha is still there in his new manifestations. So the second person in prayer, the one to whom we pray, is concrete, is really there, and we can really get in touch with him or with her. That is why it is very important to have the insight. Jesus, Buddha and grandfather are not something that only existed in the past; they are there in the here and the now. They are within you, around you, and you can get in touch with them. It’s like the Sangha; the Sangha is there, and if you have any difficulty, you just say, “dear brother, dear sister, Sangha, please help.” The Sangha is not a notion; the Sangha is reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that the Sangha is there, the community of brothers and sisters the community of practitioners is there. We can always rely on the Sangha, and the Sangha always carries the living Dharma and the living Buddha; so touching the Sangha, touching the Buddha, touching the Dharma, you touch realities. And the act of praying is very concrete. It should bring transformation and healing. When we say, “Dear Sangha, please send energy to brother so and so who is in difficulty,” we rely really on the power of the Sangha. We know that the collective energy of the Sangha is real. Because the Sangha contains the Buddha and the Dharma, we also have the energy of the Buddha, we have the living Buddha, the living Dharma with us.
If we practice well, the energy of prayer will be very powerful and right away it can effect a change. That energy is within the one who prays, within the Sangha that supports the prayer in bringing the collective energy. Since the Sangha has the living Buddha, the living Dharma, the energy can be very powerful. That energy is produced from within and it is produced from the Sangha. We know that that energy can only be generated when mindfulness, concentration and insight are there. You, the one who asks the Sangha to send energy, you have to be fully present. You have to be mindful, concentrated, and you should have the insight that you are one with the one to whom you address your prayer, and you are also one with the one you pray for. That is why insight is important in prayer; and if mindfulness, concentration and insight are present, there will be a transformation and healing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go deep, you see that if Christians pray in that way, with mindfulness, concentration and especially insight, there will be not much difference between Buddhism and Christianity. You know you are a very important part of the prayer. The effectiveness of prayer depends on you very much; because if you are not there, if you are not solid, if you do not have the insight, then you cannot get in touch with the powerful energy of the Sangha, of the Buddha. In Buddhism we do not speak of God, we do not speak of creation, we do not speak of revelation, and we do not speak of redemption or punishment. In Buddhism, what is equivalent to God is Mind, especially the collective mind. Mind is the ground of everything; and when your mind gets in touch with the collective mind, everything is possible. If our friends in Christianity see that God is the Spirit -- the collective mind from which everything manifests -- then the distance separating Buddhism and Christianity would not be much at all. It depends on the way we understand God. If we understand God as the ground of being from which everything manifests, then our understanding is not different from the Buddhist vision of mind; because in the teaching of Buddhism, mind is the artist who designs everything, especially the collective mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Why is it important to pray with the body?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that the position of our body is very important in prayer. If you join your palms, if you are in the kneeling position, then you may be more concentrated because you are addressing the Buddha, the Sangha, or Jesus with mindfulness and respect, and you are more truly present. As far as insight is concerned, in the Buddhist tradition we learn that body and mind are not two separate things. The body is part of the mind, and the mind is part of the body. The body is a continuation of the mind and the mind is a continuation of the body. Reality manifests itself as body, as mind, namarupa. When you learn of the twelve links, you know that it is because of ignorance that there is consciousness. If there is no ignorance, consciousness will be called wisdom. Because of the existence of ignorance, that thing is called consciousness. Because there is ignorance, there are impulses that will bring about consciousness; consciousness is the mind with the element of ignorance. And from consciousness manifest body and mind. Because of ignorance we think the body is not the mind and mind is not body; but both manifest from consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that kind of vision, the non-duality of mind and body, Buddhists always involve the body in prayer, in meditation. “The contemplation of the body in the body, the contemplation of the mind in the mind.” Body contains mind and mind contains body. That is why, in sitting meditation, in walking meditation, in mindful work, in the practice of breathing, mind and body always become one in order for the practice to be correct, to be fruitful. You don’t just practice meditation with your mind; your mind is only half. You have to meditate with your body. When you touch the ultimate reality, you touch it also with your body and not just your mind. When you touch the kingdom of God or the Pure Land of the Buddha, you touch them with your feet, your hands, your eyes, and not just your spirit. That is why, in the Buddhist tradition, mind and body should be one. They have manifested anyway from the same reality — consciousness -- and in the tradition of Christianity, people have been able to see that also. In order to pray, you have to be quiet; you have to go home to yourself. You have to pray with your heart and not only with your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;foundation-of-prayer&quot;&gt;Foundation of Prayer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;How can you avoid falling into the trap of falling into routine when you’re praying, the trap of going through the words or motions without paying attention?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you come up here for chanting, when you listen to the chanting, you have to involve all your body and mind. If you do so, you are in concentration, you are in mindfulness; you come into phase with the Sangha and you become one with the Sangha, like a river. You don’t exist anymore as an individual; you become the river of the Sangha. The mind should be always with the body. That is why mindful walking as a practice can be considered to be a prayer. You pray with your feet; and when you walk with mindfulness, you touch the kingdom of God, the Pure Land of the Buddha. And you can see the effectiveness of the prayer right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you breathe in and out mindfully, that is real breathing. Body and mind are united. It would be a pity if we just prayed with our mouth -- reciting something, while our mind wanders into the past or into the future, or thinks of our projects. This is not praying, because you are not mindful, you are not concentrated, you do not have the insight. The foundation of prayer is mindfulness, concentration and insight. In the Christian tradition, there are people capable of praying like that, with mindfulness, concentration, and they call it the prayer of the heart. You really pray with your spirit and body together and not just joining your palms and chanting something. When you come up for chanting, if while you chant you are thinking of something, you have to go home to yourself. “What am I doing? I am performing, I am not practicing. I am performing a chant. I am not practicing, I am not praying at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other members of the Sangha should remind you of that by their way of chanting, their way of practicing, and you have to help the Sangha to practice like that, body always together with mind, so that we can avoid the trap of practicing only with the form. This trap is universal; it can happen in Buddhism, in Christianity, and in every religion. We know that if the practice is like that, there will be no effectiveness. You do not have the Kingdom of God, you do not have the Pure Land of the Buddha, because you don’t have mindfulness, concentration and insight. I sometimes remind the Sangha before our meals together, such as by saying, “Let us breathe in such a way that many persons become one person.” We have to find ways to say our Five Contemplations before eating so that they don’t become routine, recited just in the form. We also have a poem that we can say silently to help us: “In the dimension of space and time, we chew as rhythmically as we breathe: maintaining the life of all our ancestors, opening an upward path for descendants.” If someone can remind the Sangha before eating, then everyone in the Sangha has a chance to practice in reality and not just in form. When we bow to the altar as part of a ceremony, we have another poem we can say: “The one who bows and the one who is bowed to are not separate; therefore, the communication between them is inexpressibly` perfect.” So we need to have reminders of various kinds, stimulating, exhorting, and always reminding us, so we don’t fall into that trap of practicing only in the form. We have to be skillful, artful in finding ways to keep our practice alive, and that’s why we should have some encouraging words before walking or sitting meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;prayer-in-your-daily-life&quot;&gt;Prayer in your daily life&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;There’s a chapter on meditation in your book on prayer. How do you see the relationship between meditation and prayer in your own life?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of Buddhism, anything you do that is accompanied by mindfulness, concentration and insight can be considered to be a prayer. When you drink your tea in forgetfulness, life is not there. You are not truly alive because you are not there, you are not mindful, you are not concentrated. That moment is not a moment of practice. A secular moment. But when you begin to hold your tea in mindfulness and concentration, and when you drink your tea in perfect mindfulness and concentration, it looks like you are performing a sacred ritual; and that is already a prayer. When you walk, if you enjoy every step; if every step nourishes you, transforms you, every step is a prayer. So in the teaching, the practice, the tradition of Buddhism, there is really no distinction between meditation and prayer, because when you are mindful, concentrated, when you have insight, you get in touch with the Buddha land, with the Buddha, with the Sangha. When you really pray, you get in touch with Jesus, with the Kingdom of God, and getting in touch like that has to bring about transformation and healing. When there is mindfulness, concentration and insight, there is no distinction between the one who prays and the one to whom we address our prayer. That is why the communication is deep, total; and transformation and healing must happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you walk at the airport, every step you make can be a prayer. You are truly alive; you don’t waste your time, your life. When you sit in solidity and freedom, when you breathe in and out in mindfulness, when you touch the wonders of life, that is meditation; that is also a prayer. And in true prayer, there is no longer any separation between the one who prays and the one to whom we pray. In Christianity, our friends say, “living each moment in the presence of God.” If you live with mindfulness, concentration and insight, you never leave God; you are always in touch with God, in the presence of God. When you live every moment of your daily life in the presence of God, it means your daily life is a prayer; and there are those who are capable of doing so. In Buddhism we learn that there are very concrete ways of generating the energy of mindfulness, concentration and insight, and our practice consists of generating these three energies. If these energies are there, there will no longer be any separation between the one who is praying and the one to whom we address our prayer. When you practice mindfulness while sitting, walking, cooking, washing, you don’t feel that you waste your life. You are living every moment of your life deeply. Your life becomes a prayer. Much happiness and peace result from that kind of living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;our-life-is-life-of-prayer&quot;&gt;Our life is life of Prayer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;How can people find the time to pray every day?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question has been answered partly by what has been said already. When every step becomes a prayer; when every breath becomes a prayer; when each moment of working or driving or eating becomes a prayer, you don’t need to set aside time for praying, because all your daily life is devoted to the practice of praying. Therefore, answering this question, we say that we should not divide the time in that way. Time for working, for eating, for living in forgetfulness, and then a separate time devoted to mindfulness, concentration, insight and prayer -- that is not the way we see it. Every moment of our daily life can be a moment of prayer, of meditation, of practice. We need to be trained in order to do so. There are moments when we are not truly alive, we are pulled away, carried away by our worries, our anger, our projects; and we waste our life because of that. Nobody wants to waste his or her life. We want to live our life deeply, and the only way is by praying, by generating the energy of mindfulness, concentration and insight, and then we can live very deeply every moment of our daily life. Our life is a life of practice, is a life of prayer, and there is no distinction between the time of praying and the time of “living” or non-praying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;walking-meditation&quot;&gt;Walking Meditation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;What is the one thing people can do every day that will bring them closer to the happiness they seek?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are so busy; we don’t want to do so many things. We want to know just one thing that we can do to get closer to the happiness we seek every day. I think that moving around with mindfulness, walking mindfully, may be what we propose as a gift, because we move a lot during our daily life. If you want to go from here to there, even if you need only to make five or six steps, and if you know how to make these steps mindfully, that can already be very helpful. You walk to the garage, enjoy every step you make. Don’t think of anything else, just enjoy walking. You walk to the office, to your workplace or to the dining hail: every step you make should bring you back to the here and the now so that you can enjoy what is going on. I think if all people on Earth were to know how to enjoy walking mindfully, that would transform the Earth and society already; because everyone would have the secrets of becoming more mindful, everyone would know how to enjoy each step they make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking meditation is something everyone can do. There are those of us who find it difficult to practice sitting meditation; but walking -- everyone walks. So 1 propose that everyone -- whether they are in Berkeley, or New York, or Amsterdam, or Paris, or Bangkok -- enjoy mindful walking; and every time they make a mindful step, they stop their forgetfulness, they go back to life, they touch the wonders of life for their healing and transformation. Walking meditation is very pleasant, transforming and healing. I propose to the readers of Publishers Weekly magazine that everyone takes up the practice of walking meditation to begin with, and that will change their life. When you practice walking mindfully, you include your body with your mind. You include your breath, you become fully present, fully alive, and you get closer to the happiness you are seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;mindfulness-and-peace&quot;&gt;Mindfulness and Peace&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;How is prayer related to peace and to peacemaking?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are mindful, when you are concentrated, when you have the insight, there will be more peace in your body, more peace in your mind. If you know how to allow the collective energy of the Sangha to penetrate into your body, if you know how to practice really mindful breathing, to release the tension in your body and your feelings with the practice of mindful breathing, then there is more peace in you already. The moment when you sit down and begin to breathe in, calming your mind and your body, peace has become a reality; and breathing like that is praying. And when there is the element of peace in you, you can connect with other people, and you can help others to be peaceful like you. Together you become a body of peace, the Sangha body of peace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many of us who are very eager to work for peace, but we don’t have peace within. We shout for peace, angrily, and we shout at the people who are also for peace like us. There are many groups, who are very dedicated to peacemaking, but they fight each other a lot and they cannot have peace. Peace must begin with ourselves: with the practice of sitting quietly, walking mindfully, taking care of our body, releasing the tension in our body and in our feelings. So the practice can bring peace to us right away; and when you are more peaceful, more pleasant, you can be more effective in contacting other people and inviting other people to join in the work of peacemaking. And since you are peaceful, you know how to look peacefully, how to speak peacefully, how to react peacefully, and you can persuade many people to join you in the work of promoting peace and reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot have peace just by sitting down and negotiating or making plans. You have to learn to breathe in and out to calm yourself, and you have to be able to help the other person to do like you. If there is no element of peace in you and other person, no work, no activity can be described as genuine acts of peacemaking. So the president of a nation, the prime minister of a nation, the head of a political party has to practice peace, to pray for peace in his body and mind before he can be effective in asking other prime ministers and heads of nations to join him or her in making peace. I suggest that each peace conference should begin with walking meditation, sitting meditation; someone should be there to give instructions as to how to do total relaxation to remove tension, anger and fear in body and mind. That is civilization; that is bringing a spiritual dimension into our political and social life. Peace in one’s self will bring about peace in one’s community, in the world. And in our corporation, in our school, in our party, in our city hall, we have to practice peace. Schoolteachers have to practice peace, and teach students how to practice peace. In the Congress, people have to practice peace for themselves and ask other members of the Congress to practice peace. The strategy of peace should involve practice with our body and mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Should Christians who are attracted to Buddhist teachings become Buddhists?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians who know how to generate mindfulness, concentration and insight are already Buddhist, whether they have formally taken the Five Precepts and the Three Refuges or not. They are truly Buddhist, even if they don’t call themselves Buddhist, because the essence of Buddhism is mindfulness, concentration and insight. There are Christians, who are capable of being mindful, concentrated and insightful, and they are already Buddhists; they don’t need to wear the label “Buddhist.” When they express the desire to take the Three Refuges and the Five Wonderful Precepts (Mindfulness Trainings), they know that this practice also strengthens their faith in Christianity. They know they do not lose their roots and they do not betray their tradition, based on the insight that, in their tradition, mindfulness, concentration and insight are also very important. Coming to a Buddhist practice center, they learn methods of practice that can help them generate mindfulness, concentration and insight. They know that in their tradition, these energies are also very crucial. They want to make use of their insight, their experience, in order to renew their tradition so that many young people will know more concrete ways to generate these energies. Practicing Buddhist meditation in that way not only helps them to be a better Christian, but also helps them to renew Christianity in such a way that the young generation of Christians will feel more comfortable. Every tradition should renew itself in the light of the new developments in the world; Buddhism also should renew itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we should not be caught by the appearances. There are people who call themselves “Buddhist” who in fact are not very Buddhist, because there is discrimination and dogmatism in them. They are less Buddhist than many Christians. There are many Christians who do not call themselves Buddhist, but they are more Buddhist than these “Buddhists”. We have to learn to look in that way. When a Christian embraces the Buddhist practice correctly, he will never be uprooted from his Christian heritage. In fact, he or she has more opportunity to rediscover his or her own tradition and help renew it. The right attitude is not to encourage people to be uprooted from their tradition. The right attitude is to urge them to go back to their traditions, and the practice of Buddhist mindfulness, concentration and insight should be able to do this. I think there are enough Buddhists; we don’t need to convert more people to Buddhism. Just taking care of the Buddhists we have now takes a lot of energy already. Many of them don’t practice. So let us not worry about making more Buddhists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;What did you find in Vietnam when you returned in 2005? What were your impressions?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was almost 40 years in exile. I left the country to call for a cessation of hostilities, and because of that I was not allowed to go home any more. When I came back to Vietnam, I realized that about 35 million people had been born during my absence. Most of the people I met, I didn’t know. But looking deeply, I see their parents and I am able to touch them deeply. The most outstanding fact is that there is no war anymore in Vietnam, and this is a most wonderful thing. There are other problems, like corruption, pollution, poverty; but there is no mass destruction of human lives with weapons. That is already something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went home with a Sangha of 100 monastics and 100 lay people and we wanted our delegation to be solid in mindfulness, concentration and insight as a gift to offer to the nation, to the people. We wanted our practice to be solid. We are very grateful for the monks and nuns and lay friends who came with me in that trip, because they tried their best to offer the best kind of presence to the country and the people. There was a lot of fear, suspicion, misunderstanding there, and we had to practice very deeply in order to help remove this suspicion and fear and misunderstanding. Monks and nuns stayed in temples. Of course, secret police came and spied on us. Lay people stayed in hotels, and we know that secret police also came to the hotels to inspect us. Our lay friends transformed the hotels into practice centers. They woke up early in the morning and did sitting meditation and walking meditation. They ate only vegetarian food. They never smoked, or drank wine or beer. So they began to see our authenticity as a Sangha of Buddhist practitioner. They saw that not only the monastics practice well, but also the lay people practice well. There were lay Dharma teachers in our midst. Slowly, with our perseverance, with our patience, with our loving kindness, we began to transform people. We were able to help remove wrong views in them. We helped them to reduce their fear, their suspicion, and in the last month of the trip they allowed us to hold public talks outside the temples. Before that, there was no way to persuade them to allow us to have public talks outside of temples. Many Communist cadres, governmental agents came to the talk. They never went to temples. For many of those in the Communist circle, the government circle, it was the first time they were exposed to the teaching of engaged Buddhism. They were very enthusiastic. We could see the level of fear, suspicion and misunderstanding going down every day, and we got a breakthrough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that the effect of the visit still continues. There are still a lot of things to do -- dealing with poverty, social injustice, pollution, corruption; and we have said that without brotherhood, without a spiritual dimension in our life, we cannot do that. So Communist party members and government officials are urged in these Dharma talks to embrace a spiritual dimension in order to be able to deal with difficult questions faced by the country. During the visit we organized retreats for monastics, attended by so many monastics -- more than 1000 each retreat; retreats for lay people; dharma talks; and walking meditations. Although the government did not allow the press to talk about our activities, many people in Vietnam were aware that we were there, and I believe that more than 200,000 people came and directly got in touch with the Sangha and the practice. The Dharma talks given in Vietnam have been duplicated, and the day we left Vietnam we learned that 50,000 CDs of the talks had been produced, because people need it, they want it. At this point, our root temple and Prajna temple have something like 300-400 monastics practicing in the style of Plum Village, and many people are very interested because we are an example of renewed Buddhism. We hope that the presence of these practice centers will inspire many temples and many practice centers to renew the teaching and the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;You will be 80 this year. Do you plan to retire as a spiritual teacher at any point?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Buddhism we see that teaching is done not only by talking, but also by living your own life. Your life is the teaching, is the message. And since I continue to sit, to walk, to eat, to interact with the Sangha and the people, I continue to teach, even if I have already encouraged my senior students to begin to replace me in giving Dharma talks. In the last two years, I have asked Dharma teachers, not only in the monastic circle but also in the lay circle, to come up and give Dharma talks. Many of them have given wonderful Dharma talks. Some Dharma talks have been better than mine. I see myself in my continuation, and I will not retire. I’ll continue to teach, if not by Dharma talks then in my way of sitting, eating, smiling, and interacting with the Sangha. I like to be with the Sangha. Even if I don’t give a Dharma talk, I like to join walking meditation, sitting meditation, eating in mindfulness and so on. So don’t worry. When people are exposed to the practice, they are inspired. You don’t need to talk in order to teach. You need to live your life mindfully and deeply. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
